## üí° Best Practices by Category

### üîç Q&A Discussions

**Writing Good Questions:**
```markdown
Title: "How to handle connection timeouts with large collections?"

Context: I'm working on a document search system with 500K vectors
Question: What's the best way to handle timeouts during initial load?
Environment: Python 3.11, Qdrant 1.7.0, Docker setup
What I tried: Increased timeout to 60s but still getting errors
```

**Providing Good Answers:**
- Include working code examples
- Explain the reasoning behind solutions
- Reference relevant documentation
- Test your suggestions before posting

**Marking as Answered:**
- Author: Mark the most helpful response as the accepted answer ‚úÖ
- Community: Upvote helpful answers
- Follow up with results if you try the solution

### üí° Ideas & Feature Requests

**Effective Idea Proposals:**
```markdown
Title: "Add support for filtered vector search"

Problem: Currently can't filter vectors by metadata during search
Solution: Add filter parameter to search() method
Use Case: "Find similar documents published after 2023 by specific author"
Impact: Would enable more precise searches in large collections
```

**Community Feedback:**
- Ask clarifying questions about use cases
- Suggest alternative approaches
- Discuss implementation considerations
- Vote with üëç/üëé reactions

### üéâ Show and Tell

**Compelling Project Shares:**
```markdown
Title: "Real-time chat support with Qdrant MCP + Claude"

What: Built customer support chatbot with semantic search
How: Qdrant MCP indexes support docs, Claude provides responses
Results: 80% reduction in response time, 95% accuracy
Code: [Link to GitHub repo]
Demo: [Link to live demo]
Lessons: Vector chunking strategy was crucial for accuracy
```

**Community Engagement:**
- Ask questions about technical choices
- Request code examples for interesting parts
- Share your own similar projects
- Offer collaboration opportunities

### üÜò Help Requests

**Effective Help Requests:**
```markdown
Title: "qdrant_client.exceptions.UnexpectedResponse during batch insert"

Expected: Batch insert of 1000 vectors completes successfully
Actual: Exception after ~200 vectors inserted
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create collection with 1536 dimensions
2. Generate 1000 test vectors
3. Use batch_insert() with batch_size=100
4. Error occurs on 3rd batch

Environment:
- OS: macOS 13.4
- Python: 3.11.4
- qdrant-client: 1.7.0
- Qdrant server: 1.7.0 (Docker)

Error Log:
```
qdrant_client.exceptions.UnexpectedResponse: status_code=500
```

Configuration:
```json
{
  "collection_name": "test_vectors",
  "vectors_config": {
    "size": 1536,
    "distance": "Cosine"
  }
}
```

What I Tried:
- Reduced batch_size to 50 - same error
- Checked Qdrant logs - no obvious errors
- Tested with smaller total count (100 vectors) - works fine
```

**Helping Others:**
- Ask for missing information if needed
- Provide step-by-step debugging suggestions
- Share similar experiences and solutions
- Follow up to ensure the issue is resolved

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Discussions

**Technical Architecture Discussions:**
```markdown
Title: "RFC: Implement connection pooling for high-throughput scenarios"

Background: Single connection becomes bottleneck at >1000 QPS
Proposal: Add connection pool with configurable size
Technical Details:
- Use asyncio.Queue for pool management
- Lazy connection creation
- Health checking for stale connections
- Backward compatible API

Trade-offs:
Pros: Better performance, handles connection failures
Cons: More complex resource management, increased memory usage

Questions:
1. Should pool size be auto-configured based on workload?
2. How to handle connection failures gracefully?
3. What metrics should we expose for monitoring?
```

**Code Review Discussions:**
- Link to specific PRs or commits
- Focus on architectural impacts
- Discuss testing strategies
- Consider performance implications

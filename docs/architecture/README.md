## Four-Component Architecture Summary

| Component | Role | Status | Location |
|-----------|------|--------|----------|
| **Rust Daemon** | Heavy Processing Engine | 70% Complete | `/src/rust/daemon/` |
| **Python MCP Server** | Intelligent Interface | 85% Complete | `/src/python/workspace_qdrant_mcp/` |
| **CLI Utility** | User Control & Admin | 50% Complete | `/src/python/wqm_cli/` |
| **Context Injector** | LLM Rule Injection | 0% Complete | `/src/python/context_injector/` (to be created) |

**Overall Architecture Alignment**: ~35% → Target: 100% (PRD v3.0)

## Key Architectural Principles

### Separation of Concerns
- **Rust Daemon**: CPU-intensive processing, LSP integration, file watching
- **Python MCP Server**: Claude Code interface, query intelligence, session management
- **CLI Utility**: Administrative control, configuration, daemon lifecycle
- **Context Injector**: Memory rule injection, behavioral context management

### Clean Interfaces
- **gRPC**: MCP Server ↔ Rust Daemon (operational communication)
- **CLI Commands**: User ↔ CLI Utility (administrative control)
- **SQLite Database**: Shared state with component-specific access patterns
- **Hook System**: Event-driven Context Injector activation

### Performance Requirements
- **Search Latency**: <150ms end-to-end (MCP: <50ms, gRPC: <50ms, Qdrant: <50ms)
- **Ingestion Throughput**: 1000+ documents/minute sustained
- **CLI Response Time**: <500ms for all administrative operations
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB sustained operation for Rust Daemon

### Isolation Boundaries
- **Process Separation**: Each component runs in its own process space
- **Resource Access Control**: Defined patterns for shared resource coordination
- **Interface Contracts**: Formal APIs prevent tight coupling
- **Independent Development**: Components can be developed and tested separately

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Create Context Injector component** - Critical missing piece
2. **Standardize gRPC interface** - Clean communication protocols
3. **CLI interface standardization** - Consistent user experience

### Phase 2: Isolation (Weeks 3-4)
4. **Remove boundary violations** - Clean separation enforcement
5. **Resource access patterns** - Safe coordination mechanisms

### Phase 3: Performance (Weeks 5-6)
6. **Search pipeline optimization** - Meet latency requirements
7. **Ingestion pipeline optimization** - Meet throughput requirements

### Phase 4: Integration (Weeks 7-8)
8. **Component integration testing** - End-to-end validation
9. **Documentation and migration** - Production readiness

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- **Component Isolation**: Each component tested independently
- **Interface Contracts**: API compliance and performance validation
- **Integration Flows**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Automated regression testing

### Documentation Standards
- **API Reference**: Complete interface documentation
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual system representation
- **Deployment Guides**: Production setup procedures
- **Troubleshooting**: Maintenance and debugging procedures

## Migration Considerations

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing MCP interface maintained during transition
- Configuration migration tools provided
- Gradual component isolation without service disruption

### Risk Management
- **Phased Approach**: Working system maintained at each phase
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous validation during transition
- **Rollback Procedures**: Safety mechanisms for migration issues

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All four components operational with clean boundaries
- [ ] Performance requirements met or exceeded
- [ ] Test coverage >80% for all components
- [ ] Independent component development capability achieved

## Getting Started

For implementing the four-component architecture:

1. **Read**: [Component Boundaries](./component-boundaries.md) - Understand the target architecture
2. **Study**: [Interface Specifications](./interface-specifications.md) - Learn the communication protocols
3. **Plan**: [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md) - Follow the migration path
4. **Validate**: [Data Flow and Isolation](./data-flow-and-isolation.md) - Verify correct implementation

This architecture documentation provides the foundation for building a scalable, maintainable, and high-performance semantic workspace system that meets the ambitious goals of PRD v3.0 while maintaining clean separation of concerns and independent component development capabilities.

gh workflow run orchestrated-release-pipeline.yml \
  -f release_version=0.2.1 \
  -f baseline_version=0.2.0 \
  -f deployment_strategy=canary \
  -f skip_performance_check=false
```

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### Semantic Release Integration

The new workflows integrate seamlessly with the existing `semantic-release.yml` workflow:

```yaml
# Example integration in semantic-release.yml
- name: Trigger release verification
  if: steps.release.outputs.new_release_published == 'true'
  run: |
    gh workflow run release-verification.yml \
      -f version_to_verify=${{ steps.release.outputs.new_release_version }}
```

### Monitoring Integration

All workflows integrate with the existing monitoring infrastructure:

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Dashboard creation and visualization  
- **Health Checks**: Integration with existing health check server
- **Log Aggregation**: Structured logging for all pipeline events

## Deployment Strategies

```

### Manual Interventions

Emergency procedures:
1. **Immediate Rollback**: Use release-rollback.yml
2. **Traffic Diversion**: Manual load balancer configuration
3. **PyPI Management**: Manual package yanking if needed
4. **Monitoring Bypass**: Temporary alert silencing

## Best Practices

### Release Planning
1. Always test in staging environment first
2. Plan rollback strategy before deployment
3. Communicate release schedule to stakeholders
4. Monitor key metrics during and after deployment

### Canary Deployments
1. Start with small traffic percentages (5-10%)
2. Monitor for at least 2 hours before increasing traffic
3. Have clear success/failure criteria defined
4. Prepare communication for users about new features

### Performance Testing

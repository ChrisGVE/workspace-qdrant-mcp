3. Delete test discussions after verification

### Template Customization

## üîç Search and Organization

### Search Optimization
To make discussions easily discoverable:

- Regularly update pinned content

### Archive Strategy

### Healthy Community Indicators
- Average response time < 24 hours for questions

### Warning Signs

2. **Cross-promotion** - Link discussions from README, docs, and social media
3. **Migration path** - Move appropriate issue discussions to discussions
4. **Community challenges** - Organize showcase events or development sprints

### Long-term Engagement
- **Regular AMAs** (Ask Me Anything) with maintainers
- **Feature spotlight** discussions for new releases
- **Community spotlight** highlighting outstanding contributors
- **Quarterly roadmap** reviews with community input

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Templates not appearing:**
- Check YAML syntax in template files

# Backup and Disaster Recovery Procedures

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive backup strategies and disaster recovery procedures for the Qdrant MCP workspace production deployments. The system provides automated backup scheduling, verification, monitoring, and disaster recovery capabilities.

## Architecture

### Components
- **Qdrant Vector Database**: Primary data store requiring vector collections backup
- **Configuration Management**: Application and system configuration backup
- **User Data**: Application state and user-generated content
- **Infrastructure**: Container images, deployment manifests, and infrastructure as code

### Recovery Objectives
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 30 minutes for critical services
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 15 minutes maximum data loss
- **Availability Target**: 99.9% uptime (8.77 hours downtime/year)

## Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Set up backup directories and permissions
./scripts/setup-backup-environment.sh

# Configure backup credentials and destinations
cp automation/.env.example automation/.env
# Edit automation/.env with your backup destinations
```

### 2. Run Manual Backup
```bash
# Full system backup
./scripts/backup/full-backup.sh

# Qdrant-only backup
./scripts/backup/qdrant-backup.sh

# Configuration backup
./scripts/backup/config-backup.sh
```

### 3. Verify Backup
```bash
# Verify latest backup integrity
./scripts/verification/verify-backup.sh

# Test restore procedure (non-destructive)
./scripts/testing/test-restore.sh --dry-run
```

### 4. Emergency Recovery
```bash
# Quick disaster recovery
./scripts/recovery/emergency-recovery.sh

# Follow detailed procedures in procedures/disaster-recovery.md
```

## Backup Types

### Full System Backup
- Complete Qdrant collections and snapshots
- All configuration files and secrets
- Application data and user content
- Infrastructure as code and deployment configs
- Frequency: Daily at 2:00 AM UTC

### Incremental Backup  
- Changed Qdrant collections only
- Modified configuration files
- Updated user data
- Frequency: Every 4 hours

### Real-time Replication
- Cross-region Qdrant collection replication
- Configuration synchronization
- User data streaming backup
- Frequency: Continuous (15-minute RPO)

## Monitoring Integration

The backup system integrates with the existing monitoring stack:

- **Prometheus**: Backup job metrics and success rates
- **Grafana**: Backup status dashboards and trends
- **Alertmanager**: Backup failure notifications
- **Health Checks**: Backup service health endpoints

## Security Considerations

- Encrypted backups at rest and in transit
- Access control and audit logging
- Secure credential management
- Compliance with data protection regulations

## Support and Troubleshooting

1. Check backup logs: `./scripts/backup/check-logs.sh`
2. Review monitoring dashboards in Grafana
3. Validate backup integrity: `./scripts/verification/full-verification.sh`
4. Consult runbooks in `procedures/runbooks/`

For emergency situations, follow the procedures in `procedures/disaster-recovery.md`.

## Compliance and Auditing

- Backup retention policies: 30 days local, 1 year remote
- Audit logs retained for 2 years
- Regular disaster recovery testing (monthly)
- Compliance reports generated automatically

git commit -m "feat: Complete Task 87 file watching and auto-ingestion testing

Implement comprehensive testing for file watching system covering:

Test Areas:
1. File watching system validation - WatchConfiguration, FileWatcher lifecycle
2. Automatic ingestion triggers - File events (add/modify/delete), debouncing
3. Real-time status updates - Statistics tracking, error counting
4. Watch configuration management - CRUD operations, persistence
5. Error scenario handling - Path issues, permissions, callback errors
6. Service persistence - State recovery, configuration reload
7. Performance testing - High volume processing, memory stability

Key Features:
- 35+ comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios
- Mock-based testing for external dependencies
- Temporary test environments with automatic cleanup
- Error injection and recovery testing
- Cross-platform compatibility considerations
- Performance benchmarking and memory monitoring

Modules Tested:
- core/file_watcher.py - Base file watching functionality
- core/persistent_file_watcher.py - Enhanced persistence features
- core/watch_validation.py - Validation and error recovery
- core/watch_config.py - Configuration management
- core/advanced_watch_config.py - Advanced configuration options

Error Scenarios Covered:
- Non-existent paths, permission denied, corrupted configs
- Network interruptions, disk full scenarios
- Callback errors, atomic operations
- State recovery after system restarts

Performance Validated:
- 50 files processed in <5 seconds
- <50% memory growth over extended operations
- Debouncing prevents rapid-fire processing
- Progressive error recovery backoff

Deliverables:
- Complete test suite: tests/test_file_watching_comprehensive.py
- Test runners: run_task87_file_watching_tests.py, run_file_watching_tests.py
- Test fixtures: tests/conftest.py  
- Implementation report: TASK_87_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md

Status: âœ… COMPLETED - All 7 test areas implemented and validated"

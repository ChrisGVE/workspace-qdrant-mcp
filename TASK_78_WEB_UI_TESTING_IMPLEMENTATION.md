**Documentation** (`docs/WEB_UI_TESTING.md`):
- Comprehensive usage guide
- Troubleshooting procedures
- Environment setup instructions
- Test category explanations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Mock Services Architecture
Implemented sophisticated mock daemon server providing realistic API endpoints:
```python
# API endpoints for testing
GET  /api/status                 # Daemon status
GET  /api/memory-rules          # List memory rules  
POST /api/memory-rules          # Create rule
PUT  /api/memory-rules/{id}     # Update rule
DELETE /api/memory-rules/{id}   # Delete rule
GET  /api/processing-queue      # Queue status
POST /api/processing-queue/clear # Clear queue
POST /api/safety-mode           # Toggle safety
POST /api/read-only-mode        # Toggle read-only
```

### Browser Automation Strategies
- **Robust Element Selection:** Multiple selector strategies with fallbacks
- **Async Wait Patterns:** Proper waiting for dynamic content and API responses  
- **Error Tolerance:** Graceful handling when UI elements change or are missing
- **Cross-Environment Compatibility:** Tests work with or without real services

### Dependency Management
Updated `pyproject.toml` with Playwright dependencies:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    # ... existing deps ...
    # Web UI testing
    "playwright>=1.40.0",
    "pytest-playwright>=0.4.0",
]
```

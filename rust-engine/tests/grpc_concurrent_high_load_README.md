# gRPC Concurrent Client and High-Concurrency Tests (Task 321.7)

## Overview

Comprehensive test suite for validating gRPC infrastructure under concurrent client load and high-volume request scenarios. Tests thread safety, connection pooling efficiency, resource contention handling, and performance characteristics.

## Test Categories

### 1. Multiple Concurrent Clients
- **test_10_concurrent_clients**: 10 clients × 5 requests = 50 total requests
- **test_50_concurrent_clients**: 50 clients × 3 requests = 150 total requests
- **test_100_concurrent_clients**: 100 clients × 2 requests = 200 total requests

**Validates:**
- Connection pool correctly handles concurrent client creation
- All requests complete successfully under concurrent load
- No race conditions in client initialization

### 2. High-Volume Request Tests
- **test_high_volume_sustained_load**: 10 workers × 3 seconds @ 100 req/sec target
- **test_burst_traffic_pattern**: 3 bursts × 50 requests = 150 requests

**Validates:**
- System handles sustained high request rates
- Burst traffic doesn't cause failures or resource exhaustion
- Request processing remains stable over time

### 3. Resource Contention Tests
- **test_shared_connection_pool_contention**: 20 clients × 5 requests on shared pool
- **test_multiple_pools_concurrent_access**: 2 pools × 10 workers × 3 requests

**Validates:**
- Shared connection pools handle concurrent access correctly
- Connection reuse works properly under contention
- No deadlocks or race conditions in pool access
- Multiple independent pools operate correctly

### 4. Thread Safety Validation
- **test_connection_pool_add_remove_concurrent**: Concurrent add/remove operations
- **test_client_stats_concurrent_access**: 20 health checks + 20 stats queries concurrently

**Validates:**
- Connection pool operations are thread-safe
- No data races in concurrent add/remove
- Stats collection is thread-safe
- No panics or deadlocks under concurrent operations

### 5. Connection Pooling Under Load
- **test_pool_efficiency_under_load**: 30 workers × 10 requests measuring pool efficiency
- **test_pool_reuse_pattern_validation**: Validates connection reuse across request waves

**Validates:**
- Connection pool efficiently reuses connections
- Pool size remains optimal (1 connection for single address)
- Connection reuse pattern is consistent
- No unnecessary connection creation

### 6. Performance Under Stress
- **test_latency_under_concurrent_load**: 50 clients × 5 requests measuring latency distribution
- **test_throughput_measurement**: 10 workers × 2 seconds measuring throughput

**Validates:**
- Average latency remains under 100ms under load
- Throughput achieves measurable performance (>10 req/sec)
- Min/max/avg latency metrics tracked correctly
- Performance degrades gracefully under load

### 7. Various Load Patterns
- **test_gradual_ramp_up_pattern**: 5 → 10 → 15 → 20 clients gradual increase
- **test_spike_and_cooldown_pattern**: 50 client spike + 10 sequential requests
- **test_mixed_client_configurations**: 10 default clients + 10 custom pool clients

**Validates:**
- System handles gradual load increases
- Traffic spikes are handled gracefully
- Cooldown after spike returns to normal operation
- Mixed client configurations coexist correctly

## Metrics Collection

### LoadTestMetrics Structure
Atomic counters for lock-free metric collection:
- `total_requests`: Total number of requests made
- `successful_requests`: Requests that completed successfully
- `failed_requests`: Requests that failed
- `total_latency_us`: Cumulative latency in microseconds
- `min_latency_us`: Minimum observed latency
- `max_latency_us`: Maximum observed latency
- `active_clients`: Current number of active clients

### MetricsSummary
Provides snapshot of test performance:
- Request counts and success rates
- Latency statistics (min, max, avg)
- Active client tracking

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all concurrent tests
cargo test --test grpc_concurrent_high_load --features test-utils -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture

# Run specific test category
cargo test --test grpc_concurrent_high_load test_10_concurrent_clients --features test-utils

# Run with detailed output
cargo test --test grpc_concurrent_high_load --features test-utils -- --nocapture
```

## Performance Expectations

### Latency
- **Average**: < 100ms under concurrent load
- **Min**: Typically < 10ms for healthy connections
- **Max**: Should not exceed 1000ms under normal load

### Throughput
- **Target**: > 100 requests/sec with 10 workers
- **Minimum**: > 10 requests/sec baseline
- **Burst**: Handle 50+ concurrent requests without failure

### Resource Usage
- **Pool Efficiency**: 1 connection per unique address
- **Connection Reuse**: 100% reuse rate for same address
- **Memory**: No connection leaks
- **Thread Safety**: Zero race conditions or deadlocks

## Test Infrastructure

### TestEnvironment
- Spawns gRPC server on configurable port
- Provides server address for client connection
- Manages server lifecycle (automatic cleanup on drop)
- Provides shared metrics collector

### Port Allocation
Tests use dedicated ports to avoid conflicts:
- 50070-50087: Concurrent client tests
- Each test uses unique port for isolation

## Expected Behavior

### Under Normal Load
- All requests complete successfully
- Connection pool maintains optimal size
- Latency remains low and stable
- No resource leaks or panics

### Under Stress
- Graceful degradation of performance
- No crashes or deadlocks
- Error handling works correctly
- Metrics accurately reflect system state

## Notes

- Tests use `serial_test::serial` to avoid port conflicts
- Metrics use atomic operations for thread-safe collection
- All tests clean up resources on completion
- Tests will pass once core compilation errors are fixed

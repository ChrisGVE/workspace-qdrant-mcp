# PRAGMATIC WORKSPACE-QDRANT-MCP STRESS TESTING CAMPAIGN PRD

**Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: 2025-09-06  
**Context**: Resource limits and sync reliability validation  
**File**: LT_20250906-1822_pragmatic_stress_testing_PRD.txt

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Following refinement of testing approach, focus on finding actual breaking points through systematic stress testing. Primary goals: prevent daemon resource strangulation, ensure real-time sync reliability, and establish baseline performance for future LSP integration.

## CORE TESTING OBJECTIVES

### Critical Failure Modes to Prevent
1. **Resource Strangulation**: Daemon consuming excessive resources, making system inoperable
2. **Sync Lag**: File changes not reflected quickly enough for LLM queries, returning stale data
3. **Recovery Failures**: System unable to gracefully handle resource pressure

### Success Criteria
- Identify exact breaking points for resource consumption
- Validate real-time sync performance under development loads
- Confirm built-in priority system effectiveness
- Establish LSP integration resource headroom

## AUTONOMOUS TESTING PHASES

### PHASE 1: BASELINE & SANDBOX SETUP
**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**User Input Required**: None

```bash
# Create testing environment
LT_20250906-1822_testing_sandbox/
├── baseline_metrics/          # Current project performance data
├── qmk_integration/          # Large-scale testing
├── stress_scenarios/         # Synthetic load testing
├── sync_validation/          # Real-time change testing
├── monitoring_logs/          # All performance data
└── results_summary/          # Decision-ready reports
```

**Activities**:
1. Create sandbox structure with monitoring infrastructure
2. Baseline current project ingestion (time, memory, CPU)
3. Add qmk_firmware submodule (dev branch) 
4. Establish resource monitoring (memory, CPU, disk I/O)
5. Document current daemon configuration and limits

### PHASE 2: PROGRESSIVE SCALING VALIDATION
**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**User Input Required**: None

**Scaling Sequence**:
```
1. Current workspace-qdrant-mcp project (~X files)
2. QMK firmware subset (keyboards/ directory only)
3. QMK firmware complete (full repository)
4. Synthetic stress files (large files, many small files)
```

**Measurements per Scale Level**:
- Memory consumption trajectory
- CPU usage patterns  
- Ingestion completion time
- Search response degradation
- System responsiveness impact

**Breaking Point Detection**:
- When does ingestion time become non-linear?
- At what point does system become sluggish?
- How do built-in priorities respond to resource pressure?

### PHASE 3: REAL-TIME SYNC STRESS TESTING
**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**User Input Required**: None

**Development Simulation Scenarios**:
```
Scenario A: Active Coding Session
- Continuous file modifications (every 5-30 seconds)
- New file creation bursts
- Search queries during active changes

Scenario B: Refactoring Operations  
- Mass file renames/moves
- Large content modifications
- Directory structure changes

Scenario C: Git Operations
- Branch switching with file changes
- Merge operations
- Large commit ingestion
```

**Sync Validation Protocol**:
1. Make file change
2. Measure change detection latency
3. Query for modified content immediately
4. Validate result freshness
5. Monitor processing queue depth

**Critical Measurements**:
- Change detection time (filesystem → daemon awareness)
- Processing queue backlog during heavy activity
- Search result staleness detection
- Concurrent operation impact

### PHASE 4: RESOURCE LIMIT STRESS TESTING
**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**User Input Required**: None

**Stress Scenarios**:
```
Memory Pressure Testing:
- Progressive memory consumption until limits
- Large file ingestion (multi-GB files)
- Concurrent processing stress

CPU Saturation Testing:
- Maximum concurrent file processing
- Search query bombardment during ingestion
- Embedding computation overload

Disk I/O Stress Testing:
- Rapid file creation/deletion cycles
- Large file read/write operations
- Network storage simulation
```

**Resource Guardrail Validation**:
- Test built-in priority system effectiveness
- Measure graceful degradation behavior
- Validate automatic throttling mechanisms
- Document recovery patterns

### PHASE 5: RESILIENCE & RECOVERY TESTING
**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**User Input Required**: None

**Failure Simulation**:
```
Daemon Restart Testing:
- Kill daemon during heavy processing
- Restart and measure recovery time
- Validate data consistency post-recovery

Resource Exhaustion Testing:
- Push beyond configured memory limits
- Force CPU throttling scenarios
- Test disk space exhaustion handling

Corruption Scenarios:
- Simulate Qdrant database issues
- Test partial ingestion recovery
- Validate automatic repair mechanisms
```

**Recovery Metrics**:
- Restart time to full functionality
- Data consistency after unexpected shutdown
- Automatic recovery success rate
- Manual intervention requirements

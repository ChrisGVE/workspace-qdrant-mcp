# Prioritized GitHub Issues

This document contains the prioritized issues that need to be created for the Workspace Qdrant MCP project to improve project maintenance and community engagement.

## High Priority Issues (Critical & High)

### 1. Daemon Hardcoded Log Paths
**Priority:** Critical
**Component:** daemon
**Labels:** `critical`, `daemon`, `bug`, `configuration`
**Milestone:** v0.3.0

**Title:** Fix hardcoded log paths in daemon service
**Description:** The memexd daemon currently uses hardcoded log paths that may not be accessible on all systems. This causes service startup failures and prevents proper logging.

**Issue Details:**
- Current hardcoded paths don't respect user permissions
- Service fails to start when log directories don't exist
- No fallback mechanism for alternative log locations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Use configurable log paths via config file
- [ ] Create log directories if they don't exist
- [ ] Fallback to user-writable locations (e.g., ~/.local/share/workspace-qdrant-mcp/logs)
- [ ] Update service installation scripts to handle log path configuration

### 2. Service Installation Permission Handling
**Priority:** High
**Component:** service-management
**Labels:** `high-priority`, `service-management`, `bug`, `installation`
**Milestone:** v0.3.0

**Title:** Improve service installation permission handling
**Description:** Service installation fails on systems with restrictive permissions or when users lack sudo access.

**Issue Details:**
- Installation requires sudo but doesn't gracefully handle denial
- No user-level installation option for non-privileged users
- Poor error messages when permission issues occur

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Detect available permissions before installation
- [ ] Provide user-level service installation option
- [ ] Clear error messages with suggested solutions
- [ ] Documentation for both system-wide and user-level installation

**Labels:** `high-priority`, `auto-ingestion`, `performance`, `enhancement`
**Milestone:** v0.3.0

**Title:** Optimize auto-ingestion performance for large file sets
**Description:** Auto-ingestion becomes slow and resource-intensive when monitoring directories with large numbers of files.

**Issue Details:**
- CPU usage spikes with many files in watched directories
- Memory consumption grows with number of monitored files
- File processing queue can become backlogged

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement batch processing for file ingestion
- [ ] Add configurable processing rate limits
- [ ] Optimize file watching algorithms
- [ ] Add performance metrics and monitoring
- [ ] Memory usage optimization for large file sets

## Medium Priority Issues

### 4. Documentation Improvements
**Priority:** Medium
**Component:** documentation
**Labels:** `medium-priority`, `documentation`, `enhancement`
**Milestone:** Documentation

**Title:** Comprehensive documentation overhaul
**Description:** Improve documentation coverage, examples, and user guides to reduce support burden and improve user experience.

**Issue Details:**
- Missing advanced configuration examples
- Limited troubleshooting guides
- API documentation needs expansion
- Installation guide needs platform-specific sections

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Add advanced configuration examples
- [ ] Create comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Expand API documentation with examples
- [ ] Platform-specific installation guides
- [ ] Performance tuning documentation

### 6. CLI Usability Improvements
**Priority:** Medium
**Component:** cli
**Labels:** `medium-priority`, `cli`, `enhancement`, `ui/ux`
**Milestone:** v0.3.0

**Title:** Improve CLI usability and user experience
**Description:** Enhance CLI commands with better output formatting, progress indicators, and interactive features.

**Issue Details:**
- Commands lack progress indicators for long operations
- Output formatting is inconsistent
- Missing interactive mode for complex operations
- Help text could be more descriptive

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Add progress bars for long-running operations
- [ ] Consistent output formatting across commands
- [ ] Interactive mode for configuration and setup
- [ ] Improved help text and examples
- [ ] Command aliases for common operations

## Low Priority Issues

### 7. Error Handling Enhancements
**Priority:** Low
**Component:** mcp-server
**Labels:** `low-priority`, `mcp-server`, `enhancement`, `error-handling`
**Milestone:** Future

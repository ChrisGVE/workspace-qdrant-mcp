Sprint Goal: Core authentication system foundation

Completed:
✓ Database schema design and migration scripts

   - Refresh token: 30 days expiration
   - RS256 algorithm for better security
   - Token rotation on refresh

2. Password Security
   - bcrypt with salt rounds = 12
   - Minimum password: 8 chars, 1 upper, 1 lower, 1 digit
   - Password history: prevent last 5 passwords reuse

3. Database Connection
   - Connection pool: 20 connections max
   - Query timeout: 30 seconds
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff

Code Quality Metrics:
- Test coverage: 78% (target: 90%)
- ESLint violations: 3 (down from 15)
- Security scan: 0 high/critical issues
- Performance tests: All endpoints <150ms

Lessons Learned:
- JWT payload size affects performance - keep minimal
- Database connection pool sizing critical for concurrent load
- OAuth provider documentation varies significantly in quality
- Automated testing setup time investment pays off quickly

Next Week Focus:
- Complete OAuth integration
- Implement MFA with TOTP
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Security audit with penetration testing tools"

### Problem Solving Documentation

```bash
"Store this debugging session in my scratchbook:

Bug Investigation - JWT Token Validation Failures

Issue: Random JWT token validation failures (2-3% of requests)
Started: January 17, 2024 10:30 AM
Status: RESOLVED
Resolution Time: 4 hours

Symptoms:
- Intermittent 401 Unauthorized responses
- No pattern by user, endpoint, or time
- Valid tokens failing validation randomly
- No errors in application logs

Investigation Steps:

1. ✓ Verified JWT signing key consistency across instances
   - All instances using same RS256 private key
   - Key rotation not occurring during failures

2. ✓ Checked token expiration handling
   - Tokens well within expiration window
   - Clock synchronization verified across servers

3. ✓ Analyzed load balancer configuration
   - Sticky sessions disabled (correct for stateless)
   - Health checks not interfering with auth endpoints

4. ✓ Investigated database connection issues
   - User lookup queries executing successfully
   - No connection pool exhaustion

5. 🔍 Deep-dive into JWT validation library
   - Found issue: jsonwebtoken library caching public keys
   - Race condition during high concurrency
   - Cache corruption under load

Root Cause:
Race condition in jsonwebtoken library's public key caching mechanism
Multiple concurrent requests accessing cached key during validation
Corruption of cached key object under high load

Solution Applied:
```javascript
// Before: Shared cached verification
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const publicKey = fs.readFileSync('public-key.pem');

const verifyToken = (token) => {
  return jwt.verify(token, publicKey, { algorithms: ['RS256'] });
};

// After: Instance-specific key handling
const crypto = require('crypto');
const publicKeyObject = crypto.createPublicKey({
  key: fs.readFileSync('public-key.pem'),
  format: 'pem'
});

const verifyToken = (token) => {
  return jwt.verify(token, publicKeyObject, { algorithms: ['RS256'] });
};
```

Validation:
- 48 hours with zero validation failures
- Load testing: 1000 concurrent users, 0% failure rate
- Memory usage reduced by 15% (less caching overhead)
- Response time improved by 5ms average

Prevention Measures:
1. Added comprehensive JWT validation tests with concurrency
2. Implemented monitoring for token validation failure rates
3. Created alerting for >0.1% authentication failure rate
4. Documented JWT library configuration best practices

Lessons Learned:
- Third-party library caching can introduce race conditions
- High-concurrency testing reveals different issues than sequential tests
- Monitor authentication metrics as closely as business metrics
- Cryptographic operations need special attention in concurrent environments

Knowledge Shared:
- Presented findings in team tech talk
- Updated authentication service documentation
- Added to team's debugging playbook
- Contributed fix to open-source jsonwebtoken library"

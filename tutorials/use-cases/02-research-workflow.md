Experiment Plan: Attention Mechanisms for Legal Document Analysis

Research Question: Can attention-based models improve contract clause extraction accuracy?

Hypothesis: Bidirectional attention models will outperform traditional NER approaches for legal clause identification due to better context understanding.

Dataset:
- Legal contract corpus (1,000 contracts)
- Annotated clause types (confidentiality, termination, liability)
- Train/dev/test split: 70/15/15

Baseline Models:
1. Rule-based pattern matching
2. CRF with hand-crafted features
3. BiLSTM-CRF
4. Standard BERT-base

Proposed Models:
1. Legal-domain BERT (pre-trained on legal texts)
2. Longformer (for long document context)
3. BigBird with legal vocabulary adaptation
4. Custom attention patterns for legal structure

Evaluation Metrics:
- Precision, Recall, F1 for each clause type
- Exact match accuracy
- Processing time per document
- Model size and memory requirements

Success Criteria:
- F1 > 0.85 for all clause types
- Processing time < 30s per document
- Comparable or better than commercial solutions

Timeline:
Week 1-2: Data preprocessing and baseline implementation
Week 3-4: BERT variants training and evaluation
Week 5-6: Advanced attention models
Week 7-8: Analysis and paper writing

Resources Needed:
- GPU cluster access for training
- Legal domain expertise consultation
- Commercial baseline comparison
- Statistical significance testing"

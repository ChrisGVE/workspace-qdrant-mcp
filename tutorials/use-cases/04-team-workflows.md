## Collaborative Knowledge Building

### Team Learning Sessions
```bash
"Store this learning session summary in team-knowledge collection:

Team Learning Session: Microservices Communication Patterns
Date: January 18, 2024
Facilitator: Sarah Chen (Principal Engineer)
Attendees: 8 developers, 2 product managers

Session Goals:
- Understand communication patterns in our microservices architecture
- Share experiences and lessons learned from current implementations  
- Identify patterns to standardize vs avoid
- Plan improvements for Q1 2024

Knowledge Shared:

Current Communication Patterns in Use:
1. Synchronous REST APIs
   - Used by: User service ↔ Auth service
   - Pros: Simple, well-understood, good for request-response
   - Cons: Tight coupling, potential cascading failures
   - Team experience: Works well for critical path, problematic for non-critical

2. Asynchronous Message Queues (RabbitMQ)
   - Used by: Order service → Inventory service → Shipping service
   - Pros: Loose coupling, resilient to service failures
   - Cons: Eventual consistency, debugging complexity
   - Team experience: Great for workflows, harder to troubleshoot

3. Event Streaming (Kafka)
   - Used by: User events → Analytics service → Recommendation service
   - Pros: High throughput, replay capability, multiple consumers
   - Cons: Infrastructure complexity, message ordering challenges
   - Team experience: Powerful for data pipelines, steep learning curve

4. GraphQL Federation
   - Used by: Frontend → API Gateway → Multiple services
   - Pros: Single endpoint, flexible queries, strong typing
   - Cons: Query complexity, caching challenges
   - Team experience: Good developer experience, performance concerns

Lessons Learned Shared:

From Mike (Backend Team Lead):
'Synchronous calls for critical user flows, async for everything else. We learned this the hard way when payment processing was delayed by a slow recommendation service call.'
→ Documented in team-knowledge: Critical path identification methodology

From Lisa (Frontend Developer):
'GraphQL federation is amazing for development speed, but we needed to add query complexity analysis to prevent expensive queries in production.'
→ Added to team-knowledge: GraphQL performance patterns

From Tom (DevOps):
'Message queue monitoring is crucial. Silent failures in async systems can accumulate for hours before detection.'
→ Documented in team-knowledge: Async system monitoring checklist

From Alex (Junior Developer):
'Event sourcing seemed complex initially, but it made debugging user journey issues much easier.'
→ Added to team-knowledge: Event sourcing learning resources

Team Decisions Made:

Communication Pattern Guidelines:
1. Synchronous REST for:
   - Real-time user interactions
   - Critical business transactions
   - Simple request-response patterns
   - Maximum latency <100ms acceptable

2. Asynchronous Messaging for:
   - Business process workflows  
   - Non-critical data updates
   - Cross-team service communication
   - Fan-out notification patterns

3. Event Streaming for:
   - High-volume data processing
   - Multiple consumer scenarios
   - Analytics and ML pipelines
   - Audit log and compliance data

4. GraphQL Federation for:
   - Frontend data aggregation
   - Developer productivity scenarios
   - Gradual API evolution
   - Complex data relationship queries

Standardization Initiatives:

Q1 2024 Goals:
1. Create service communication decision tree
2. Standardize monitoring for all communication patterns

### Cross-Team Knowledge Sharing
```bash
"Store this knowledge transfer session in team-knowledge collection:

Cross-Team Knowledge Transfer: Authentication System
Date: January 20, 2024
From: Platform Team → Product Teams
Context: Product teams implementing authentication in their services

Participants:
- Platform Team: Sarah (Auth Lead), Mike (Security), Tom (DevOps)
- Product Teams: 6 developers from User, Order, and Analytics teams
- Duration: 2 hours (presentation + hands-on)

Knowledge Transferred:

Authentication Architecture Overview:
1. Centralized auth service with distributed token validation
2. JWT tokens with RS256 signing for stateless validation
3. OAuth 2.0 integration for third-party providers
4. Role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions

Implementation Patterns:

JWT Token Validation Middleware:
```javascript
// Shared authentication middleware pattern
const authenticateJWT = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const token = req.headers.authorization?.replace('Bearer ', '');
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, publicKey, { algorithms: ['RS256'] });
    
    // Add user context to request
    req.user = {
      id: decoded.sub,
      email: decoded.email,
      roles: decoded.roles || [],
      permissions: decoded.permissions || []
    };
    
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === 'TokenExpiredError') {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Token expired', code: 'TOKEN_EXPIRED' });
    }
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token', code: 'INVALID_TOKEN' });
  }
};
```

Permission-Based Authorization:
```javascript
// Authorization middleware for granular permissions
const requirePermission = (permission) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.user) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });
    }
    
    if (!req.user.permissions.includes(permission)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ 
        error: 'Insufficient permissions', 
        required: permission 
      });
    }
    
    next();
  };
};

// Usage in routes
app.get('/admin/users', authenticateJWT, requirePermission('users.read'), getUsersHandler);
app.post('/admin/users', authenticateJWT, requirePermission('users.create'), createUserHandler);
```

Integration Best Practices Shared:

1. Token Refresh Handling
   - Implement automatic token refresh in client applications
   - Use refresh tokens for extended sessions
   - Handle token expiration gracefully with user feedback

2. Error Handling Standards
   - Consistent error codes across all services
   - User-friendly messages vs detailed logs
   - Security considerations (don't leak information)

3. Performance Optimizations
   - Cache user permissions for session duration
   - Use Redis for session data and blacklisted tokens
   - Implement connection pooling for auth service calls

4. Security Considerations
   - Never log tokens or sensitive auth data
   - Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
   - Monitor for unusual authentication patterns

Common Integration Issues and Solutions:

Issue 1: Token Validation Failures Under Load
- Symptoms: Intermittent 401 errors during high traffic
- Root Cause: Public key caching race conditions
- Solution: Proper key object handling (shared in session)

Issue 2: Permission Checking Performance
- Symptoms: Slow API responses for permission-heavy endpoints
- Root Cause: Database lookup on every request
- Solution: Token-embedded permissions with cache invalidation

Issue 3: Cross-Service Authorization Complexity
- Symptoms: Inconsistent permission enforcement across services
- Root Cause: Each service implementing custom authorization
- Solution: Shared authorization service with standardized checks

Hands-On Implementation:

Practice Exercises Completed:
1. Integrate JWT validation middleware (all teams)
2. Implement role-based route protection (all teams)
3. Handle token refresh in frontend applications (frontend devs)
4. Configure proper error handling and logging (all teams)

Team-Specific Integration Plans:

User Team:
- Integrate auth middleware by January 25

## Step 5: Claude Integration Testing

### Test Claude Desktop Integration

1. **Open Claude Desktop**
2. **Start a new conversation**
3. **Run integration tests**:

```
Test 1: "Can you list what MCP tools are available?"
Expected: Should mention qdrant-find, qdrant-store, and others

Test 2: "Search my project for authentication information"  
Expected: Should return stored authentication content

Test 3: "Store this note in my scratchbook: Integration test passed successfully on [current date]"
Expected: Should confirm storage and mention collection name

Test 4: "What collections do I have available?"
Expected: Should list project and global collections
```

### Test Claude Code Integration

```bash
# From your project directory
claude mcp list
```

**Expected output should include**:
```
Available MCP servers:
- workspace-qdrant-mcp: Active (5 tools available)
  Tools: qdrant-find, qdrant-store, qdrant-list, qdrant-admin, qdrant-health
```

## Step 6: End-to-End Workflow Test

Perform a complete workflow to simulate real usage:

### Scenario: New Feature Development

1. **Store Implementation Notes**
```  
Claude: "Store this in my scratchbook: Starting work on user profile feature. Plan to implement: profile editing, avatar upload, privacy settings, account deactivation."
```

2. **Store Technical Specifications**
```
Claude: "Store this in my project collection: User Profile API Specification

Endpoints:
GET /api/user/profile - Retrieve user profile  
PUT /api/user/profile - Update profile information
POST /api/user/avatar - Upload profile picture
DELETE /api/user/account - Deactivate account

Fields: name, email, bio, avatar_url, privacy_level, created_at, updated_at"
```

3. **Search for Related Information**
```
Claude: "Search for anything related to user authentication that might affect profile implementation"
```

4. **Verify Cross-Reference**
```  
Claude: "Search for profile or user-related functionality"
```

**Expected results**: Should find both new profile content and existing authentication content, showing how information builds on itself.

## Step 7: Performance Under Load

Test system performance with multiple operations:

```bash
# Generate test load
workspace-qdrant-test --load-test
```

**Expected output**:
```  
🏋️ Load Testing Results

📈 Concurrent Operations Test:
   - 50 concurrent searches: 156ms avg response
   - 20 concurrent stores: 234ms avg response  
   - Mixed operations: 198ms avg response
   - Error rate: 0%

💪 Stress Test:
   - 100 documents stored: 12.3s total
   - 500 searches performed: 23.1s total
   - Memory peak: 340MB  
   - CPU peak: 45%

🎯 Reliability Test:
   - 1000 operations: 100% success rate
   - Network errors: 0
   - Timeout errors: 0  
   - Data consistency: Verified

✅ Load Test: PASSED
   System handles expected production load
```

## Step 8: Configuration Validation

Validate your configuration is optimal:

```bash
# Validate configuration
workspace-qdrant-validate
```

**Expected output**:
```
✅ Configuration Validation

🔧 Environment Variables:
   ✅ QDRANT_URL: http://localhost:6333 (reachable)
   ✅ FASTEMBED_MODEL: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (valid)
   ✅ COLLECTIONS: project (valid)
   ✅ GLOBAL_COLLECTIONS: references (valid)
   ⚠️  GITHUB_USER: Not set (subprojects disabled)

📁 Project Detection:  
   ✅ Git repository detected
   ✅ Project name valid: my-test-project
   ✅ Collection naming compliant

🏗️  Collection Configuration:
   ✅ All configured collections created
   ✅ Dimensions consistent (384)
   ✅ Indexing optimal for workload

💡 Optimization Suggestions:
   1. Set GITHUB_USER for subproject support
   2. Consider BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 for better quality
   3. All critical settings properly configured

🎉 Configuration: Valid and Optimal
```

## Troubleshooting Verification Issues

### Performance Issues
```bash
# If benchmarks show poor performance
workspace-qdrant-health --analyze

# Check system resources
top | grep -E "(qdrant|python|Claude)"

# Optimize Qdrant if needed
curl -X PUT http://localhost:6333/collections/my-test-project-scratchbook/index \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"index_params": {"m": 16, "ef_construct": 200}}'
```

### Integration Issues
```bash
# If Claude integration fails
cat ~/.config/claude-desktop/claude_desktop_config.json

# Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes
# Test MCP connection
claude mcp test workspace-qdrant-mcp
```

### Collection Issues  
```bash
# If collections missing or corrupted
wqutil workspace-status
workspace-qdrant-setup --reconfigure

# Rebuild if necessary
wqutil rebuild-collections --confirm
```

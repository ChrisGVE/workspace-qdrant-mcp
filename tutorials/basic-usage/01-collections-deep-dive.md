## Overview
Collections are the organizational backbone of workspace-qdrant-mcp. This tutorial explores advanced collection concepts, management strategies, and optimization techniques for complex workflows.

**Estimated time**: 45-60 minutes

## Step 1: Advanced Collection Architecture

### Understanding Collection Hierarchy

workspace-qdrant-mcp creates a sophisticated hierarchy of collections based on your project structure:

```
Workspace Collections Architecture:

📁 Project-Scoped Collections
   ├── {project}-scratchbook    # Personal development journal
   ├── {project}-{type}         # Configured collection types
   └── {subproject}-{type}      # Subproject collections (with GITHUB_USER)

🌐 Global Collections
   ├── {name}                   # Shared across all projects
   └── {name}-{variant}         # Specialized global collections

🔗 Cross-Collection Search
   └── All collections searched simultaneously
```

### Advanced Configuration Examples

#### Multi-Service Application
```bash
export COLLECTIONS="api,frontend,backend,docs,tests,infra"
export GLOBAL_COLLECTIONS="standards,security,tools"

# For project "ecommerce-platform" creates:
# ecommerce-platform-scratchbook (automatic)
# ecommerce-platform-api
# ecommerce-platform-frontend  
# ecommerce-platform-backend
# ecommerce-platform-docs
# ecommerce-platform-tests
# ecommerce-platform-infra
# standards (global)
# security (global)  
# tools (global)
```

#### Research Environment
```bash
export COLLECTIONS="papers,experiments,data,analysis"
export GLOBAL_COLLECTIONS="bibliography,methods,references"

# For project "ml-research-2024" creates:
# ml-research-2024-scratchbook
# ml-research-2024-papers
# ml-research-2024-experiments
# ml-research-2024-data
# ml-research-2024-analysis
# bibliography (global)
# methods (global)
# references (global)
```

#### Team Documentation Hub
```bash
export COLLECTIONS="docs,guides,tutorials,specs"
export GLOBAL_COLLECTIONS="templates,standards,glossary"

# Creates comprehensive documentation structure
```

## Step 2: Collection Lifecycle Management

### Creation and Initialization

Collections are created automatically when first used:

```bash
# Check what collections would be created
wqutil workspace-status

# Force collection creation (without storing documents)
wqutil ensure-collections

# Create collections with custom configuration
wqutil create-collection my-project-custom --dimensions 768 --distance cosine
```

### Collection Information and Metrics

```bash
# Detailed collection information
wqutil collection-info my-project-scratchbook
```

**Expected output**:
```
📊 Collection: my-project-scratchbook

   - Consider reindexing if >10,000 documents
```

## Step 3: Collection-Specific Operations

### Targeted Collection Storage

While cross-collection search is automatic, you can target specific collections for storage:

```bash
# Store in specific collection (via Claude)
"Store this technical specification in my project docs collection: [content]"
"Add this meeting note to my scratchbook: [content]"  
"Save this reference to my global tools collection: [content]"
```

### Collection-Specific Search

For performance or focus, search within specific collections:

```bash
# Search specific collection type
"Search only my scratchbook for development notes about authentication"
"Find technical documentation in my project docs collection"
"Look in my references collection for OAuth information"
```

### Bulk Operations

```bash
# Batch import to specific collection
workspace-qdrant-ingest /path/to/docs --collection my-project-docs --format md,txt

# Export collection contents
wqutil export-collection my-project-scratchbook --format json --output backup.json

# Import to collection
wqutil import-collection my-project-scratchbook --input backup.json
```

## Step 4: Advanced Collection Strategies

### Semantic Collection Organization

Organize collections by semantic purpose rather than technical structure:

#### By Information Type
```bash
export COLLECTIONS="decisions,implementations,issues,research"
# decisions: Architecture decisions, design choices
# implementations: Code, configurations, how-to guides  
# issues: Bug reports, troubleshooting, problems
# research: Investigation, analysis, external resources
```

#### By Development Phase
```bash  
export COLLECTIONS="planning,development,testing,deployment"
# planning: Requirements, designs, specifications
# development: Code, implementation notes, progress
# testing: Test cases, results, quality assurance
# deployment: Infrastructure, release notes, operations
```

#### By Audience
```bash
export COLLECTIONS="internal,external,team,personal"
# internal: Company-specific information
# external: Public documentation, open source
# team: Shared team knowledge and processes  
# personal: Individual notes and development journal
```

### Collection Naming Best Practices

#### Consistent Naming Patterns
```bash
# Good: Descriptive, consistent, hierarchical
export COLLECTIONS="api-docs,api-tests,api-monitoring"
export COLLECTIONS="frontend-components,frontend-styles,frontend-tests"

# Avoid: Generic, ambiguous names  
export COLLECTIONS="stuff,things,misc"
```

#### Semantic Grouping
```bash
# Group related collections with prefixes
export COLLECTIONS="user-auth,user-profile,user-settings"
export COLLECTIONS="data-models,data-migration,data-backup"
```

## Step 5: Multi-Project Collection Management

### Project Detection and Isolation

Each Git repository gets isolated collections:

```bash
# Project A: /path/to/project-a/
cd /path/to/project-a
wqutil workspace-status
# Collections: project-a-scratchbook, project-a-project, etc.

# Project B: /path/to/project-b/  
cd /path/to/project-b
wqutil workspace-status
# Collections: project-b-scratchbook, project-b-project, etc.
```

### Shared Global Collections

Global collections are accessible from all projects:

```bash
# From any project, access global collections
"Store this coding standard in my global standards collection"
"Search my global references for OAuth best practices"
```

### Cross-Project Search

Search across multiple projects when needed:

```bash
# Advanced: Search across specific projects (requires custom tooling)
wqutil search-across-projects "authentication patterns" --projects project-a,project-b
```

## Step 6: Collection Optimization

### Performance Tuning

#### Index Optimization
```bash
# Optimize collection index for better search performance
wqutil optimize-collection my-project-scratchbook

# Custom index parameters for large collections
wqutil reindex-collection my-project-scratchbook \
  --m 32 \
  --ef-construct 400 \
  --ef-search 200
```

#### Memory Management
```bash
# Monitor collection memory usage
wqutil memory-usage --collections

# Optimize memory for large collections
wqutil configure-collection my-project-docs \
  --on-disk-payload true \
  --max-segment-size 50000
```

### Storage Optimization

#### Disk Usage Management
```bash
# Check disk usage across collections
wqutil disk-usage --detailed

# Cleanup unused vectors (after document deletion)
wqutil cleanup-collection my-project-scratchbook

# Compact collection storage
wqutil compact-collection my-project-scratchbook
```

#### Archival and Backup
```bash
# Archive old collections
wqutil archive-collection old-project-scratchbook --compress

# Backup critical collections
wqutil backup-collections --include-global --output backup-2024-01-15.tar.gz

# Restore from backup
wqutil restore-collections backup-2024-01-15.tar.gz
```

## Step 7: Advanced Search Patterns

### Collection-Aware Search Strategies

#### Layered Search Approach
```bash
# 1. Search personal notes first
"Search my scratchbook for recent thoughts on user interface design"

# 2. Expand to project documentation  
"Search my project docs for official UI design specifications"

# 3. Include global references
"Search all my collections for UI design patterns and guidelines"
```

#### Context-Driven Collection Selection
```bash
# Development context - focus on implementation collections
"Search my development and testing collections for database connection issues"

# Documentation context - focus on docs and references
"Search my docs and references collections for API documentation standards"

# Problem-solving context - focus on issues and solutions
"Search my scratchbook and issues collections for similar authentication problems"
```

### Semantic Collection Queries

```bash
# Query by information type
"Find all architecture decisions I've documented"
"Show me implementation patterns I've saved"
"What troubleshooting steps have I documented?"

# Query by project phase
"What planning documents exist for this feature?"
"Find all testing strategies I've developed"
"Show deployment procedures I've documented"
```

## Step 8: Collection Integration Patterns

### Development Workflow Integration

#### Code Review Integration
```bash
# Store code review findings
"Store this code review feedback in my project quality collection: 
Found potential race condition in user authentication middleware.
Recommend adding proper locking mechanisms and retry logic.
Similar issue was resolved in payment service - check commit abc123."
```

#### Issue Tracking Integration  
```bash
# Cross-reference with issue trackers
"Store this bug investigation in my issues collection:
Issue #1234: Login timeout on mobile devices
Root cause: JWT token size exceeds mobile browser limits
Solution: Implement token compression or split into claims
Related: Issues #1456, #1789 had similar token size problems"
```

### Documentation Workflow

#### Knowledge Transfer
```bash
# Capture team knowledge
"Store this team knowledge in my team collection:
New developer onboarding checklist:
1. Set up development environment (see infra collection)
2. Review architecture decisions (see decisions collection)  
3. Complete security training (see security global collection)
4. Shadow experienced developer for one week
5. Complete first feature with code review"
```

## Troubleshooting Collection Issues

### Collection Not Created
```bash
# Debug collection creation
wqutil debug-collections --verbose

# Force collection creation
wqutil ensure-collections --force

# Check configuration issues
workspace-qdrant-validate --focus collections
```

### Collection Performance Issues
```bash
# Analyze collection performance
wqutil analyze-performance my-project-scratchbook

# Reindex if performance degrades
wqutil reindex-collection my-project-scratchbook --background

# Monitor real-time performance
wqutil monitor-collection my-project-scratchbook --watch
```

### Collection Corruption
```bash
# Verify collection integrity
wqutil verify-collection my-project-scratchbook

# Repair minor corruption
wqutil repair-collection my-project-scratchbook --auto-fix

# Rebuild from backup if needed
wqutil rebuild-collection my-project-scratchbook --from-backup latest.json
```

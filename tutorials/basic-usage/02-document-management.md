# Document Management

## Objectives
- Master document storage strategies and best practices
- Understand document chunking and processing
- Learn document metadata and tagging techniques
- Implement document lifecycle management
- Optimize document retrieval and organization

## Prerequisites
- [Getting Started](../getting-started/) section completed
- [Collections Deep Dive](01-collections-deep-dive.md) completed
- Basic understanding of vector embeddings

## Overview
Effective document management is crucial for building a useful knowledge base. This tutorial covers advanced document storage, organization, and lifecycle management techniques.

**Estimated time**: 45-60 minutes

## Step 1: Document Structure and Best Practices

### Optimal Document Characteristics

**Ideal document length**: 200-2000 characters
- Long enough to contain meaningful context
- Short enough for focused search results
- Balanced for semantic coherence

**Good document examples**:
```
Good (coherent, focused):
"Authentication middleware implementation using JWT tokens. The middleware validates tokens, checks expiration, and refreshes when needed. Error handling includes 401 for invalid tokens and 403 for expired tokens without refresh capability. Used in all protected API routes."

Avoid (too fragmented):
"JWT tokens"
"Middleware"  
"Authentication"

Avoid (too long):
[3000-character documentation blob with multiple unrelated topics]
```

### Document Content Guidelines

#### Technical Documentation
```
Structure: Purpose ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Usage ‚Üí Edge Cases

Example:
"Rate Limiting Implementation for API Endpoints

Purpose: Prevent API abuse and ensure fair usage across clients

Implementation: Redis-based sliding window counter
- Key format: 'rate_limit:{user_id}:{endpoint}:{window}'  
- Window size: 1 hour, max 100 requests
- Exponential backoff for repeated violations

Usage: Applied automatically to all /api/ routes via middleware
- Headers: X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset
- Returns 429 Too Many Requests when exceeded

Edge Cases:
- Anonymous users: IP-based limiting (50 requests/hour)
- Premium users: Higher limits (500 requests/hour)
- Health check endpoints: No rate limiting applied"
```

#### Meeting Notes and Decisions
```
Structure: Context ‚Üí Decision ‚Üí Rationale ‚Üí Action Items

Example:
"Architecture Review - Database Choice Decision

Context: Evaluating PostgreSQL vs MongoDB for user data storage

Decision: Selected PostgreSQL for primary user data

Rationale:
- Strong consistency requirements for financial data
- Existing team expertise with SQL
- Better tooling for data analysis and reporting
- ACID compliance essential for transactions

Action Items:
- Mike: Set up PostgreSQL cluster by Friday
- Sarah: Design initial schema with proper indexing
- Team: Migrate development environment next week
- Lisa: Update API layer for SQL queries"
```

#### Development Notes and Insights
```
Structure: Problem ‚Üí Investigation ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Lessons Learned

Example:
"Memory Leak Investigation - Worker Thread Pool

Problem: Application memory usage growing continuously in production

Investigation:
- Profiled with py-spy and memory_profiler
- Identified worker threads not being properly cleaned up
- Thread pool using strong references to task objects
- Tasks containing large data payloads not being garbage collected

Solution: 
- Implemented weak references in thread pool manager
- Added explicit cleanup in task completion handlers
- Set maximum thread pool size with recycling policy
- Added memory monitoring alerts

Lessons Learned:
- Always profile production workloads, not just development
- Thread pool management requires explicit lifecycle handling
- Memory monitoring should be part of standard deployment
- Weak references are essential for long-running thread pools"
```

## Step 2: Advanced Document Storage

### Rich Document Storage with Context

Store documents with enhanced context for better retrieval:

```bash
# Store with rich context
"Store this API documentation with context in my project docs:

Context: User Management API v2.1, implemented January 2024
Tags: api, authentication, user-management, rest, jwt
Priority: high
Related: user-service, auth-middleware, database-schema

Content: User Profile Management Endpoints

GET /api/v2/users/profile
- Retrieves current user profile information
- Authentication: JWT token required
- Response: UserProfile object with id, name, email, avatar_url
- Error codes: 401 (unauthorized), 404 (user not found)

PUT /api/v2/users/profile  
- Updates user profile information
- Authentication: JWT token required
- Body: Partial UserProfile object
- Validation: name (3-50 chars), email (valid format)
- Response: Updated UserProfile object
- Error codes: 400 (validation), 401 (unauthorized), 422 (duplicate email)

This API replaced the v1 endpoints which are deprecated as of March 2024."
```

### Document Templates for Consistency

Create templates for common document types:

#### Bug Report Template
```
"Store this bug report template in my standards collection:

```

### Batch Document Processing

#### Import Existing Documentation
```bash
# Bulk import from documentation directory
workspace-qdrant-ingest /path/to/docs \
  --collection my-project-docs \
  --formats md,txt,rst \
  --recursive \
  --preserve-structure

# Preview what would be imported
workspace-qdrant-ingest /path/to/docs \
  --collection my-project-docs \
  --dry-run \
  --verbose
```

**Expected output**:
```
üìÅ Scanning: /path/to/docs

üìã Files to Process:
‚úÖ README.md (2.3KB) ‚Üí my-project-docs
‚úÖ api/authentication.md (4.1KB) ‚Üí my-project-docs  
‚úÖ api/users.md (3.2KB) ‚Üí my-project-docs
‚úÖ deployment/docker.md (5.7KB) ‚Üí my-project-docs
‚úÖ troubleshooting/common-issues.txt (2.8KB) ‚Üí my-project-docs
‚è≠Ô∏è  images/architecture.png (skipped - binary)

üìä Summary:
- 5 documents to process
- Total size: 18.1KB
- Estimated processing time: 23s
- Target collection: my-project-docs

Run without --dry-run to process files.
```

#### Structured Content Extraction
```bash
# Extract and store specific sections from large documents
workspace-qdrant-ingest /path/to/large-doc.md \
  --collection my-project-docs \
  --extract-sections \
  --section-headers "h2,h3" \
  --min-section-length 100
```

## Step 3: Document Metadata and Tagging

### Automatic Metadata Extraction

workspace-qdrant-mcp automatically extracts and stores metadata:

```json
{
  "document_id": "doc_12345",
  "content": "Authentication middleware implementation...",
  "metadata": {
    "collection": "my-project-docs",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:22Z",
    "source": "manual_entry",
    "content_length": 847,
    "embedding_model": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    "project": "my-project",
    "tags": ["authentication", "middleware", "jwt"],
    "priority": "high",
    "context": "User Management API v2.1"
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Document Storage with Metadata

```bash
# Store with explicit metadata
"Store this implementation guide with metadata:

Metadata:
- Type: implementation-guide
- Component: authentication-service  
- Version: 2.1.0
- Author: development-team
- Last-updated: 2024-01-15
- Complexity: medium
- Dependencies: jwt-library, redis, postgresql

Content: JWT Token Refresh Implementation

The token refresh mechanism implements a sliding window approach to maintain user sessions without requiring frequent re-authentication. When a JWT token has less than 15 minutes remaining before expiration, the client can request a new token using the refresh endpoint.

Implementation details:
1. Refresh tokens are stored in Redis with 30-day expiration
2. Each refresh generates a new access token and refresh token pair
3. Previous refresh tokens are immediately invalidated
4. Rate limiting prevents abuse: max 10 refreshes per hour per user
5. Concurrent refresh requests are handled with Redis locks

Security considerations:
- Refresh tokens are single-use only
- Tokens include jti (JWT ID) for tracking and revocation
- All refresh attempts are logged for security monitoring
- Suspicious patterns trigger automatic account protection"
```

### Custom Tagging Strategies

#### Semantic Tagging
```bash
# Tag by domain concepts
Tags: authentication, authorization, security, jwt, tokens, middleware, api

# Tag by system components  
Tags: user-service, auth-service, api-gateway, database, cache

# Tag by development phase
Tags: planning, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance
```

#### Workflow Tagging
```bash
# Tag by work status
Tags: in-progress, review-needed, completed, blocked, deprecated

# Tag by priority
Tags: critical, high-priority, medium-priority, low-priority, backlog

# Tag by audience
Tags: public-docs, internal-docs, team-only, personal-notes
```

## Step 4: Document Lifecycle Management

### Document Versioning

While workspace-qdrant-mcp doesn't have built-in versioning, implement versioning patterns:

```bash
# Version-aware document storage
"Store this updated API documentation:

Document: User API Documentation v2.2
Previous-version: v2.1 (stored 2024-01-10)
Changes: Added user preferences endpoint, deprecated profile settings endpoint

Content: [updated documentation content]

Migration notes:
- Clients should migrate from /api/v2/users/settings to /api/v2/users/preferences
- Settings endpoint deprecated but functional until v3.0
- New preferences endpoint supports nested configuration objects"
```

### Document Updates and Evolution

```bash
# Update existing documents with change tracking
"Update my authentication documentation with these changes:

Changes made on 2024-01-16:
- Added OAuth2 integration support
- Updated rate limiting from 100 to 150 requests/hour
- Added new error code 429 for rate limiting
- Documented new refresh token rotation policy

Updated sections:
- OAuth Integration (new)
- Rate Limiting (modified)  
- Error Handling (expanded)
- Security Policies (updated)"
```

### Document Archival and Cleanup

```bash
# Archive outdated documents
"Store this archival note:

ARCHIVED DOCUMENTATION NOTICE

Document: Legacy API v1.0 Documentation
Archived: 2024-01-15
Reason: API v1.0 deprecated, replaced by v2.0
Retention: Keep for reference until 2025-01-15
Migration: All endpoints migrated to v2.0 with backwards compatibility

For current documentation, see: API v2.0 Documentation
For migration guide, see: API Migration Guide v1-to-v2"
```

Common Issues:
1. JWT Token Expired
   - Symptoms: 401 Unauthorized responses
   - Solution: Implement token refresh (see Implementation Guide: JWT Token Refresh)
   - Prevention: Set up client-side token monitoring

2. Rate Limiting Triggered  
   - Symptoms: 429 Too Many Requests
   - Solution: Implement exponential backoff
   - Reference: Rate Limiting Documentation (my-project-docs collection)
   
3. Database Connection Timeout
   - Symptoms: 500 Internal Server Error on auth endpoints

```

## Step 6: Document Search Optimization

### Search-Friendly Document Structure

#### Use Clear Headings and Structure
```
Good structure for search:

"Database Migration Process - User Table Updates

Overview: Process for safely updating user table schema in production

Prerequisites:
- Database backup completed  
- Migration script tested in staging
- Rollback plan prepared

Steps:
1. Enable maintenance mode
2. Create table backup: CREATE TABLE users_backup AS SELECT * FROM users
3. Run migration script: [specific SQL commands]
4. Verify data integrity: [validation queries]
5. Disable maintenance mode

Rollback Procedure:
If issues occur, restore from users_backup table
Estimated downtime: 15-30 minutes

Testing Checklist:
‚ñ° All user authentication flows working
‚ñ° User profile data intact
‚ñ° Performance metrics within acceptable range"
```

#### Include Search Keywords
```
"API Performance Optimization Guide

Keywords: performance, optimization, API, latency, throughput, caching, database, queries

This guide covers techniques for improving API response times and handling higher request volumes. Topics include database query optimization, response caching strategies, connection pooling, and monitoring setup."
```

### Document Chunking for Large Content

For large documents, break into focused sections:

```bash
# Instead of one large document, store as focused sections:

"Store section 1 in my docs: Database Schema Design - User Tables
[content about user table structure]"

"Store section 2 in my docs: Database Schema Design - Indexing Strategy  
[content about database indexes]"

"Store section 3 in my docs: Database Schema Design - Migration Procedures
[content about schema migrations]"
```

**Estimated time**: 45-60 minutes

## Step 1: Installation and Configuration

### Add MCP Server to Claude Code

```bash
# Add workspace-qdrant-mcp to Claude Code
claude mcp add workspace-qdrant-mcp

# Verify installation
claude mcp list
```

**Expected output**:
```
Available MCP servers:
âœ… workspace-qdrant-mcp: Active (5 tools available)
   Tools: qdrant-find, qdrant-store, qdrant-list, qdrant-admin, qdrant-health
   Status: Connected to http://localhost:6333
```

### Configure Project-Specific Settings

Create or update `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workspace-qdrant-mcp": {
      "command": "workspace-qdrant-mcp",
      "env": {
        "QDRANT_URL": "http://localhost:6333",

  }
}
```

### Test Integration

From your project directory:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Test MCP availability  
# In Claude Code interface:
"What MCP tools do you have available?"

# Test basic functionality
"Search my project for authentication implementation details"
```

## Step 2: Development Workflow Integration

### Code Development with Context

#### Starting New Features

**Workflow Pattern**:
```bash
# 1. Search existing knowledge before starting
claude> "I'm about to implement user profile management. Search my project for existing user-related code patterns and database schemas."

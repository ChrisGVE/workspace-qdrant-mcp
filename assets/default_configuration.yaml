# =============================================================================
# DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Purpose: Controls deployment-specific behavior including asset file locations,
# base paths, and environment-specific settings. This section determines whether
# the application runs in development mode (using project-relative paths) or
# production mode (using system-installed paths).
deployment:
  # develop: Development mode toggle for asset and configuration file resolution
  # Purpose: Controls whether to use development (project-relative) or production paths
  # Development mode (true): Assets loaded from project "assets/" directory
  # Production mode (false): Assets loaded from system installation directories
  # Security: Production mode provides better isolation and security
  # Maintenance: Production mode enables centralized configuration management
  # Override: Local configurations can set develop=true for development work
  # Default reasoning: false ensures production deployments use proper system paths
  # Platform paths (production mode):
  #   - Linux: /usr/share/workspace-qdrant-mcp/assets/
  #   - macOS: /usr/local/share/workspace-qdrant-mcp/assets/
  #   - Windows: %ProgramFiles%\workspace-qdrant-mcp\assets\
  # Format: Boolean true/false
  develop: false

  # base_path: Override base path for asset and configuration file resolution
  # Purpose: Allows custom base directory when standard paths are not suitable
  # Usage: Optional override for both development and production deployments
  # Examples: "/opt/workspace-qdrant", "/usr/local/workspace-qdrant"
  # Security: Ensure path is readable by application user/service account
  # Precedence: If set, overrides both develop=true and develop=false behavior

# validation for system data protection and disaster recovery.
#
# Purpose:
#   - Define backup/restore behavior and validation rules
#   - Configure version compatibility checking strictness
#   - Control development version handling
#   - Set backup retention and storage policies
#
# Usage:
#   - CLI commands: wqm backup create/restore/list/info/validate
#   - Automatic backups before major operations
#   - Manual backup scheduling and retention
#   - Disaster recovery and rollback procedures

backup:
  # enabled: Master control for backup/restore functionality
  # Purpose: Allow disabling backup features in environments where not needed
  # Format: boolean
  # Default reasoning: Enabled by default for data protection
  # Usage:
  #   - Production: Enable for disaster recovery
  #   - Development: Can disable to reduce overhead
  #   - Testing: Enable for backup system validation
  # Example: Set to false in ephemeral test environments
  enabled: true

  # auto_backup_before_restore: Create safety backup before restore operations
  # Purpose: Prevent data loss from failed or problematic restore operations
  # Format: boolean

  # Usage:
  #   - Always creates timestamped backup before restore
  #   - Allows rollback if restore fails or causes issues
  #   - Can be overridden with --no-auto-backup flag in CLI
  # Example: Disable only when explicitly restoring to empty system
  auto_backup_before_restore: true

  # default_backup_directory: Default location for backup storage
  # Purpose: Centralized backup storage location if not specified
  # Format: string (path) or null for user prompt
  # Default reasoning: null to force explicit path specification
  # Usage:
  #   - Set to absolute path for automated backups
  #   - Leave null to require path in CLI commands
  #   - Can use environment variables: ${HOME}/.wqm/backups
  # Example: "/var/backups/wqm" or "~/.wqm/backups"
  default_backup_directory: null

  # retention_days: Number of days to retain old backups (0 = never delete)
  # Purpose: Automatic cleanup of old backups to manage disk space
  # Format: integer (days)

  # Example: Set to 365 for yearly audit requirements
  retention_days: 30

  # compression: Enable compression for backup storage
  # Purpose: Reduce backup storage size at cost of CPU during backup/restore
  # Format: boolean
  # Default reasoning: Enabled by default for efficient storage
  # Usage:
  #   - Typically 5-10x compression ratio for vector data
  #   - Slower backup/restore but significant storage savings

  # Example: Disable in high-performance environments with ample storage
  compression: true

  # validation:
  #   Controls version compatibility checking and validation behavior
  #   during backup creation and restore operations
  validation:
    # strict_version_check: Enforce strict semantic version compatibility
    # Purpose: Control whether to allow any version mismatches during restore
    # Format: boolean

    # Usage:
    #   - true: Only exact major.minor versions allowed (patch can differ)
    #   - false: Allow minor version differences with warnings
    #   - Major version differences always rejected regardless of setting
    # Example: Set to false for development environments with frequent version changes
    strict_version_check: true

    # allow_dev_versions: Permit restoring from development version backups
    # Purpose: Enable testing of backup/restore in development environments
    # Format: boolean

    # Usage:
    #   - true: Allow 0.2.2 → 0.2.1 restore (patch downgrade)
    #   - false: Reject any restore from newer version (including patches)
    #   - Requires --allow-downgrade flag if disabled
    # Example: Enable if frequently rolling back emergency patches
    allow_patch_downgrade: false

    # allow_minor_downgrade: Allow restoring from newer minor versions
    # Purpose: Support major rollbacks across minor version boundaries
    # Format: boolean
    # Default reasoning: Disabled by default due to compatibility risks
    # Usage:
    #   - true: Allow 0.3.0 → 0.2.x restore (minor downgrade)
    #   - false: Reject minor version downgrades
    #   - High risk of data structure incompatibility
    # Example: Enable only for emergency disaster recovery scenarios
    # WARNING: May cause data loss or corruption if schemas changed
    allow_minor_downgrade: false

    # version_warning_threshold: Days before flagging backup as potentially stale
    # Purpose: Warn users when restoring old backups that may have compatibility issues
    # Format: integer (days)
    # Default reasoning: 90 days as reasonable threshold for version drift
    # Usage:
    #   - Shows warning if backup older than threshold
    #   - Suggests creating fresh backup from current version
    #   - Does not prevent restore, only warns
    # Example: Set to 30 for fast-moving projects, 180 for stable releases

    # Usage:
    #   - Validates backup structure and manifest
    #   - Checks file checksums if available
    #   - Prevents restore from corrupted backups
    #   - Adds ~5-15 seconds to restore time
    # Example: Disable only in emergency recovery scenarios
    verify_before_restore: true

    # checksum_algorithm: Algorithm for backup file integrity verification
    # Purpose: Detect file corruption or tampering in backups
    # Format: string ("xxhash64", "sha256", "md5", "none")
    # Default reasoning: xxhash64 for speed with good collision resistance
    # Usage:
    #   - xxhash64: Fastest, good for routine verification
    #   - sha256: Cryptographically secure, slower but tamper-proof
    #   - md5: Legacy compatibility, not recommended for security

    # custom_metadata: User-defined metadata to include in all backups
    # Purpose: Allow tagging backups with custom organizational metadata
    # Format: dictionary of key-value pairs
    # Default reasoning: Empty by default, user can add as needed
    # Usage:
    #   - Add tags like environment, purpose, ticket number
    #   - Useful for backup management and automation
    #   - Included in manifest.json metadata section
    # Example:
    #   custom_metadata:

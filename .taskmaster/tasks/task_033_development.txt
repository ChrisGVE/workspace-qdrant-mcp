# Task ID: 33
# Title: Add structured logging and observability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive logging, metrics collection, and monitoring capabilities for production deployments
# Details:
Add structured logging using Python structlog throughout application. Replace print statements with proper logging calls. Implement log levels: DEBUG (development), INFO (operational events), WARNING (performance issues), ERROR (failures), CRITICAL (system failures). Add metrics collection compatible with Prometheus: request counts, response times, error rates, queue lengths, memory usage. Create health check endpoints for monitoring. Add performance monitoring dashboards using Grafana templates. Implement log rotation and retention policies.

# Test Strategy:
Verify structured logs contain useful context. Test metrics collection accuracy. Validate health check endpoints return correct status. Test dashboard templates with sample data.

# Task ID: 32
# Title: Complete PyPI automated publishing setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Finalize automated PyPI releases with semantic versioning and comprehensive verification
# Details:
Complete existing .github/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml setup. Implement semantic release automation using python-semantic-release or similar. Add automated changelog generation from conventional commits. Ensure wheel building works for all platforms (review .github/workflows/rust-wheels.yml). Add release verification: install from PyPI in clean environment, run basic functionality tests, verify CLI commands work. Implement staged rollout capability and rollback mechanisms for failed releases. Add release notifications via GitHub releases and tags.

# Test Strategy:
Test automated release process in test environment. Verify wheels build correctly for all platforms. Test PyPI installation and basic functionality post-release.

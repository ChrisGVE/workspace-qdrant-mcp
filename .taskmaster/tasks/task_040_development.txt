# Task ID: 40
# Title: Create video tutorial scripts and interactive documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 27
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive video tutorial scripts and enhance documentation with interactive elements
# Details:
Create detailed video tutorial scripts: 5-minute quick start (installation to first successful search), 15-minute comprehensive overview (key features, configuration, common workflows), 30-minute advanced features deep dive (performance optimization, enterprise features, troubleshooting). Scripts should include: exact commands to run, expected outputs, common gotchas, visual elements (screen recordings, diagrams). Enhance documentation with interactive elements: copy-paste code blocks with run buttons, interactive configuration generators, embedded demo environments. Consider asciinema for terminal recordings.

# Test Strategy:
Test video scripts by following them exactly. Verify interactive elements work across different browsers. Ensure copy-paste functionality preserves formatting.

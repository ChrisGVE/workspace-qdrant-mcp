# Details:
Phase A: Ingest entire project (src + all files) as baseline test dataset
Phase B: Add large external projects to database 
Phase C: Test performance AND recall/precision metrics on both datasets
Goal: Validate search accuracy scales properly with database size
Measure search quality alongside performance metrics

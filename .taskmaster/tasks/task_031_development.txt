# Task ID: 31
# Title: Implement web ingestion with security hardening
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add secure web content ingestion with malware protection and access controls
# Details:
Implement web ingestion features: single page ingestion, recursive crawling with depth/domain limits, robots.txt compliance. Add security hardening: malware scanning using clamav-python or similar, URL validation and whitelist/blacklist, content sanitization, size limits (max file size, max pages per domain), rate limiting with respectful crawling delays. Use requests-html or scrapy for crawling, beautifulsoup4 for content extraction. Implement sandboxed processing for untrusted content. Add audit logging for all web ingestion activities.

# Test Strategy:
Test single page and recursive crawling. Verify security controls block malicious content. Test rate limiting respects server resources. Validate robots.txt compliance.

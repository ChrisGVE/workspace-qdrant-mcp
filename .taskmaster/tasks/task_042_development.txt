# Task ID: 42
# Title: Create backup and disaster recovery procedures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive backup strategies and disaster recovery procedures for production deployments
# Details:
Create backup and recovery documentation: Qdrant collection backup procedures (using Qdrant snapshots), configuration backup strategies, data export/import tools, automated backup scheduling. Implement disaster recovery procedures: system recovery from backups, data integrity verification, service restoration steps, rollback procedures. Add backup testing procedures: regular restore testing, data integrity validation, recovery time measurement. Create recovery automation scripts where possible. Include guidance for different deployment scenarios (local, cloud, enterprise).

# Test Strategy:
Test backup procedures create valid, restorable data. Verify disaster recovery procedures work from scratch. Measure and document recovery times.

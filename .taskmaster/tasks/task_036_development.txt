# Task ID: 36
# Title: Enhance README with professional badges and structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 35
# Priority: high
# Description: Improve README visual hierarchy and add comprehensive project status badges without overwhelming content
# Details:
Add professional badge collection: PyPI version/downloads (pypi.org badges), GitHub stars/forks (shields.io), CI/CD status (from .github/workflows/), security scan status (from existing security.yml), documentation status, license badge (enhance existing). Improve visual hierarchy: clear section headers, better code block formatting, improved table layouts, logical information flow. Add 'Used by' section placeholder for future adoption. Ensure badges provide value without visual clutter. Update project description to be more compelling for first-time visitors.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all badges display correctly and link to appropriate sources. Test README rendering on GitHub, PyPI, and documentation sites. Ensure professional appearance.

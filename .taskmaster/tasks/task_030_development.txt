# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement Rust engine priority system
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Add priority-based task queuing and preemption in Rust ingestion engine for responsive MCP requests
# Details:
Enhance rust-engine/ with priority queue system. Priority levels: 1) MCP requests (highest, preempt lower), 2) Project watching/ingestion (high), 3) CLI commands (normal), 4) Background folder watching (low). Implement in rust-engine/core/src/processing.rs: task queue with priority ordering, graceful preemption for lower priority tasks, request queuing with timeout handling. Add inter-process communication between Python MCP server and Rust engine. Use tokio for async task management and cancellation. Ensure data consistency during preemption.

# Test Strategy:
Test MCP requests preempt lower priority operations. Verify graceful task cancellation without data corruption. Measure response time improvements for high-priority requests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define priority task types and queue structures [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define priority levels (MCP, Project watching, CLI commands, Background watching) and create async-compatible task queue structures in Rust
### Details:
Create enum TaskPriority with levels 1-4. Define Task struct with priority, payload, cancellation token. Implement PriorityQueue using std::collections::BinaryHeap with priority ordering. Add TaskQueue trait for async operations including enqueue, dequeue, and cancellation methods. Create task types for each priority level with specific payload structures.

## 2. Implement tokio-based async task manager [done]
### Dependencies: 30.1
### Description: Build the core async task execution engine using tokio for concurrent task processing with cancellation support
### Details:
Implement TaskManager struct using tokio::sync::Mutex for thread safety. Create async spawn_task method that returns JoinHandle for cancellation. Add task state tracking (Running, Cancelled, Completed). Implement graceful cancellation using tokio::task::spawn and CancellationToken. Create task timeout handling using tokio::time::timeout. Add concurrent task limit configuration.

## 3. Create preemption logic for lower priority tasks [done]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.2
### Description: Implement task preemption system that can gracefully cancel lower priority tasks when higher priority requests arrive
### Details:
Add preemption checking in TaskManager::enqueue method. Implement graceful task cancellation with data consistency checks. Create PreemptionPolicy trait with strategies (immediate, at_checkpoint, delay). Add task checkpoint system for safe cancellation points. Implement rollback mechanisms for partially completed operations. Track preempted tasks for potential retry.

## 4. Implement inter-process communication channel [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create communication channel between Python MCP server and Rust engine for priority task submission
### Details:
Extend existing gRPC service in rust-engine/grpc/src/service.rs to include priority task submission methods. Add TaskRequest and TaskResponse protobuf definitions. Implement async RPC methods submit_priority_task, cancel_task, get_task_status. Create Python client wrapper in python-bindings to interface with MCP server. Add connection pooling and error handling for IPC failures.

## 5. Integrate priority system into processing pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.2, 30.3
### Description: Modify the existing processing.rs Pipeline struct to use the new priority-based task management
### Details:
Replace existing Pipeline struct in processing.rs with PriorityPipeline that uses TaskManager. Refactor document processing methods to work with priority tasks. Add priority-aware batch processing that can be preempted. Implement task progress tracking and status reporting. Create processing context that maintains state during preemption. Add configuration for priority thresholds and preemption policies.

## 6. Add request queuing with timeout handling [done]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.4
### Description: Implement request queuing system with configurable timeouts for different priority levels
### Details:
Create RequestQueue with priority-based timeout configuration. Implement async timeout handling using tokio::time::timeout. Add request retry logic for timed-out operations. Create queue backpressure handling to prevent memory exhaustion. Implement queue metrics collection (queue depth, wait times, timeout rates). Add graceful degradation when queues are full.

## 7. Implement data consistency mechanisms during preemption [done]
### Dependencies: 30.3, 30.5
### Description: Add safeguards to ensure data integrity when tasks are preempted mid-execution
### Details:
Implement transaction-like semantics for document processing operations. Add checkpoint/rollback system for partially completed ingestions. Create atomic operation boundaries that cannot be preempted. Implement state recovery mechanisms for interrupted tasks. Add consistency validation after preemption events. Create operation logs for debugging preemption issues.

## 8. Add monitoring and metrics for priority system performance [done]
### Dependencies: 30.2, 30.6
### Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring and metrics collection for the priority system performance analysis
### Details:
Add metrics collection using tokio-metrics for task execution times by priority. Implement queue depth and wait time tracking. Create preemption frequency and success rate metrics. Add performance comparison metrics (before/after priority system). Implement health check endpoints for priority system status. Create performance dashboards and alerting thresholds. Add logging for priority decisions and preemption events.

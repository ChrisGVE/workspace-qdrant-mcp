# Description: Enable and configure GitHub Discussions with appropriate categories for community support and engagement
# Details:
Enable GitHub Discussions for the repository. Configure discussion categories: General (questions and chat), Ideas (feature requests and suggestions), Help (troubleshooting and support), Show and Tell (user projects and examples), Development (contributor discussions). Create welcome discussion with community guidelines. Set up discussion templates and moderation policies. Create initial discussions to seed community engagement: welcome post, feature roadmap discussion, use case sharing. Configure notifications for maintainers. Integrate discussions with existing issue templates where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Verify discussion categories work correctly. Test discussion templates guide good conversations. Ensure moderation tools are accessible to maintainers.

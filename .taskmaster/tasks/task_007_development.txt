# Task ID: 7
# Title: Design and implement Rust ingestion engine architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational Rust engine for v0.2.0 with gRPC communication, file processing, and embedded deployment in Python package
# Details:
- Design gRPC protocol for Python MCP â†” Rust engine communication
- Implement embedded Rust engine deployment (maturin/setuptools-rust)
- Create engine lifecycle management (start, graceful shutdown, reconnection)
- Build basic file conversion system (text, PDF, code with LSP auto-detection)
- Implement graceful shutdown with work completion logic
- Set up platform distribution for Tier 1 platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows Intel/ARM)

# Test Strategy:

# Task ID: 39
# Title: Add alerting and monitoring templates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 33
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create monitoring configurations, alerting rules, and dashboard templates for production monitoring
# Details:
Create monitoring and alerting configurations: Prometheus alerting rules for common issues (high memory usage, slow response times, error rate spikes, queue backlog), Grafana dashboard templates (system overview, performance metrics, error tracking, user activity), health check monitoring scripts. Add monitoring setup documentation: installation guides, configuration examples, best practices. Create alert runbooks: common issues, diagnostic steps, resolution procedures. Include monitoring for both Python application and Rust engine components.

# Test Strategy:
Test alerting rules trigger correctly with simulated issues. Verify dashboard templates display meaningful data. Test monitoring scripts detect actual problems.

# Task ID: 43
# Title: Add enterprise authentication and multi-tenancy considerations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: low
# Description: Design and document enterprise-grade security features and multi-tenant architecture patterns
# Details:
Design enterprise security framework: authentication integration (OAuth2, SAML, LDAP), authorization system (role-based access control, collection-level permissions), audit logging (user actions, data access, administrative changes). Document multi-tenancy patterns: collection isolation strategies, user workspace separation, resource quotas and limits, billing/usage tracking considerations. Create enterprise deployment guides: proxy integration, network security, compliance considerations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX). Include security hardening checklist and penetration testing guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Design review with security experts. Validate authentication integration examples. Test multi-tenancy isolation effectiveness. Review compliance documentation accuracy.

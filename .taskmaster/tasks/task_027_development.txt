# Task ID: 27
# Title: Create comprehensive examples suite
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Build diverse examples across different domains and use cases beyond current single demo
# Details:
Expand examples/ directory with: software_development/ (code documentation workflow, project onboarding, architecture decisions), research/ (academic papers, citation management, literature reviews), business/ (meeting notes, knowledge base, document management), personal/ (personal wiki, learning notes, idea management). Add integrations/: vscode/ (workspace setup, task integration), cursor/ (IDE configuration), automation/ (CLI scripts, batch processing). Include real sample data, complete configuration files, and working scripts. Each example should be self-contained and immediately usable.

# Test Strategy:
Test each example in isolation. Verify all configuration files work. Ensure sample data is representative and useful. Test automation scripts execute successfully.

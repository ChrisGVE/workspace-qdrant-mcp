# Task ID: 41
# Title: Implement automated release verification and rollback
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive release testing and automated rollback capabilities for failed deployments
# Details:
Implement post-release verification: install from PyPI in clean environment, run comprehensive test suite including integration tests, verify CLI commands function correctly, test MCP server startup and basic operations, performance regression testing. Add automated rollback mechanisms: detect failed releases via monitoring, automatic PyPI version retraction if possible, emergency hotfix deployment process, communication templates for users. Implement staged rollout: release to test PyPI first, gradual rollout with monitoring, automated promotion to full release. Add release health monitoring for first 24 hours.

# Test Strategy:
Test release verification catches actual problems. Verify rollback procedures work under different failure scenarios. Test staged rollout process end-to-end.

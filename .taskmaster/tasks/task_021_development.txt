# Task ID: 21
# Title: Clean ANSI color codes from git commit history
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Scan and clean all commit messages containing ANSI color escape sequences to maintain professional git history
# Details:
Use git log --grep with regex to find commits containing ANSI escape sequences like `[38;2;127;132;156m`, `[0m`, etc. Create a backup branch before modification. Use git filter-branch or git rebase --root -i with a script to clean commit messages while preserving all functional changes. Test approach on a copy of repository first. Sequences to clean: \[\d+;\d+;\d+;\d+;\d+m, \[0m, and other ANSI color codes. Ensure commit graph integrity is maintained.

# Test Strategy:
Run git log --oneline --color=never | grep -E '\[[0-9;]+m' to verify no color codes remain. Test git log --graph shows clean history. Verify all commits still reference correct file changes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create backup branch before git history modification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a backup branch to preserve current state before attempting any git history modifications
### Details:
Create a backup branch named 'backup-before-ansi-cleanup' or similar to ensure we can restore the repository if the cleaning process goes wrong. This provides a safety net for the git history modification operations.

## 2. Identify all commits containing ANSI escape sequences [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Scan the entire git history to find all commits with ANSI color codes in their messages
### Details:
Use git log commands with grep patterns to identify commits containing ANSI escape sequences. Based on the analysis, we found commits with patterns like [38;2;127;132;156m, [0m, and other ANSI color codes. Create a comprehensive list of affected commit SHAs.

## 3. Analyze ANSI escape sequence patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Document all ANSI escape sequence patterns found in commit messages for comprehensive cleaning
### Details:
Analyze the found commit messages to identify all ANSI escape sequence patterns including: \[38;2;\d+;\d+;\d+m (RGB color codes), \[0m (reset codes), \[\d+;\d+;\d+;\d+;\d+m (complex sequences), and any other color/formatting codes present.

## 4. Create test repository copy for safe experimentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Create a complete copy of the repository to test the cleaning approach without affecting the main repository
### Details:
Clone the repository to a temporary location or create a test worktree to experiment with git filter-branch or interactive rebase approaches. This ensures we can test the cleaning process thoroughly before applying to the main repository.

## 5. Develop ANSI cleaning script [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Create a script to remove ANSI escape sequences from commit messages while preserving message content
### Details:
Develop a script (shell, Python, or other) that can process commit messages and remove all identified ANSI escape sequences while preserving the actual commit message content. The script should handle all patterns found in step 3 and maintain readability.

## 6. Test cleaning approach on repository copy [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.4, 21.5
### Description: Apply the cleaning script using git filter-branch or interactive rebase on the test repository
### Details:
Test the cleaning approach using either git filter-branch --msg-filter or git rebase --root -i with the cleaning script. Verify that the process successfully removes ANSI codes while maintaining commit graph integrity and preserving all file changes.

## 7. Verify commit graph integrity after cleaning [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.6
### Description: Ensure the git commit graph remains intact and all relationships are preserved after ANSI cleaning
### Details:
After the cleaning process, thoroughly verify that the commit graph structure is maintained, all branches point to correct commits, tags are preserved, and the repository state is consistent. Check for any corruption or missing references.

## 8. Apply cleaning process to main repository [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.7
### Description: Apply the tested and verified cleaning process to the main repository
### Details:
After successful testing, apply the same cleaning process to the main repository. Use the exact same method that was verified to work in the test repository. Ensure backup branch exists before proceeding.

## 9. Validate cleaned git history [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.8
### Description: Perform comprehensive validation that all ANSI codes are removed and repository functions correctly
### Details:
Run comprehensive checks to ensure all ANSI escape sequences are removed from commit messages throughout the entire git history. Verify that the repository functions normally and all references are intact.

## 10. Document cleaning process and cleanup [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.9
### Description: Document the cleaning process, remove temporary files, and finalize the professional git history
### Details:
Document the cleaning process used, remove any temporary scripts or test repositories, and verify the final state of the professional git history. Consider updating any documentation that references the cleaning process.

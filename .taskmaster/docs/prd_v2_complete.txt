# workspace-qdrant-mcp PRD v2.0 - Complete Specification

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 2025-08-30  
**Status:** Complete Specification - Ready for Implementation

## Executive Summary

The workspace-qdrant-mcp evolves into a comprehensive semantic workspace platform with knowledge graph capabilities, automated ingestion, version-aware document management, and memory-driven LLM behavior. This major architectural redesign introduces a Rust-based ingestion engine, reserved collection naming conventions, unified CLI, and Claude Code SDK integration for personalized AI workflows.

## Strategic Vision

### Core Philosophy
- **Memory-driven**: LLM behavior controlled by persistent user preferences and rules
- **Semantic-first**: Every piece of content becomes searchable knowledge with relationships
- **Version-aware**: Track document evolution with intelligent precedence and conflict resolution
- **Unified interface**: Single command (`wqm`) with domain-specific subcommands
- **Performance-driven**: Rust engine for heavy processing, Python MCP for interface
- **User responsibility**: Adults make decisions, system provides tools not babysitting

## Architectural Overview

### Two-Process Architecture

**Python MCP Server** (Interface Layer):
- User-facing MCP tools and search interface
- Claude Code SDK integration for memory rule injection
- Fast response times for queries and configuration
- Research mode orchestration across four search contexts
- Memory conflict resolution and session initialization

**Rust Ingestion Engine** (Processing Layer):
- Background daemon for heavy processing with graceful lifecycle
- Document parsing, conversion, embedding generation
- File watching for projects (automatic) and libraries (user-configured)
- Knowledge graph construction and relationship extraction
- LSP integration for enhanced code analysis

### Communication Protocol
- **gRPC**: High-performance binary protocol between Python MCP and Rust engine
- **Graceful lifecycle**: Engine cancels shutdown if new work arrives during shutdown
- **Signal handling**: MCP loads → starts engine → MCP quits → notifies engine → engine finishes queue before shutdown
- **Reconnection**: If MCP restarts while engine finishing task, shutdown cancelled until work complete

### Platform Distribution Strategy
**Tier 1 Platforms** (Pre-built wheels):
- macOS Intel + Apple Silicon  
- Linux x86_64
- Windows x86_64 + ARM64

**Tier 2 Platforms** (Source distribution):
- Linux ARM (aarch64) - technical users comfortable with compilation

## Collection Architecture

### Reserved Collection Names

**1. Memory Collection**: `memory`
- **Type**: Pure knowledge graph storing user preferences and LLM behavioral rules
- **Content**: User preferences ("Use uv for Python"), LLM rules ("Always make atomic commits"), agent library
- **Interface**: CLI entry + conversational updates ("Note: call me Chris")
- **Authority Levels**: 
  - `absolute`: Non-negotiable, always follow
  - `default`: Follow unless explicitly overridden by user/PRD in current context
- **Conflict Resolution**: User choice required, conditional rules supported
- **Session Integration**: Rules automatically injected into Claude Code system context at startup

**2. Library Collections**: `_{name}`
- **Pattern**: User-defined libraries prefixed with underscore
- **Readonly**: MCP server cannot modify, only Rust engine writes via CLI
- **Display**: User sees `library`, actual collection is `_library`
- **Conflict Prevention**: Hard error - if `_library` exists, `library` cannot be created
- **Examples**: `_technical-books`, `_reference-docs`, `_standards`
- **Watching**: User configures folder watching via `wqm watch` for auto-ingestion

**3. Project Collections**: `{project-name}-{type}`
- **Types**: `-scratchbook`, `-docs`, `-code` (if not using memexd)
- **Dynamic**: Created based on project detection when MCP starts in project directory
- **Writable**: Full read/write access via MCP tools
- **Auto-watching**: Project folders automatically watched when MCP server active

### Collection Name Restrictions
- Collections starting with `_` cannot be created via MCP (reserved for libraries)
- Reserved names: `memory` (global knowledge graph)
- Naming conflicts prevented at creation time with clear error messages

## Memory System - LLM Behavior Control

### Memory-Driven Claude Code Integration

**Session Initialization Flow**:
1. MCP server starts in Claude Code
2. Load all memory rules from `memory` collection
3. Detect conflicts using Claude/Sonnet semantic analysis
4. If conflicts: prompt user for resolution, update memory collection
5. Inject clean rules into Claude Code system context via SDK
6. Session starts with personalized LLM behavior

### Memory Categories and Schema
```yaml
# User Preferences (CLI entry + conversational updates)
preferences:
  user_name: "Chris"
  standards: "Use XDG standard for config files"
  tooling: "Use uv exclusively for Python package management"
  development: "When writing Python, use exclusively uv"

# LLM Behavioral Rules (CLI entry + conversational updates)
behaviors:
  supervisor_role: |
    "You are a supervisor. Supervise subagents and ensure delivery. 
    Take charge only when agents fail, then resume supervision. 
    Make decisions per PRD. If human decision needed, move to next task.
    Offer suggestions when appropriate."
    
  commit_discipline: |
    "Always make atomic commits following conventional commit format.
    Read at least 2000 lines of context before making changes."

# Agent Library (for deployment decisions)
agent_library:
  python-pro: 
    description: "Expert Python developer with modern practices"
    capabilities: ["fastapi", "async", "testing", "type-hints"]
    deploy_cost: "medium"
    
  task-orchestrator:
    description: "Manages complex multi-task workflows"  
    capabilities: ["dependency-analysis", "parallel-execution"]
    deploy_cost: "low"
```

### Memory Authority and Conflict Resolution
```yaml
memory_entry:
  rule: "Always make atomic commits"
  authority: "absolute"  # Non-negotiable
  scope: "all_sessions"
  source: "user_explicit"
  
vs.

memory_entry:
  rule: "Use pytest for testing when working on new projects, otherwise use unittest"
  authority: "default"  # Can override if context demands
  scope: "development_tasks"
  source: "user_conversational"
  conditions:
    - trigger: "new_projects"
      action: "use pytest"
    - default: "use unittest"
  replaces: ["previous_unittest_rule"]
```

### Dynamic Memory Updates
- **Conversational Updates**: "For future reference, always use TypeScript strict mode"
- **Immediate Activation**: Memory changes apply to current session instantly
- **Conflict Detection**: Hybrid approach - rule-based (fast) + LLM semantic analysis (thorough)
- **Token Management**: `wqm memory tokens` shows current usage, `wqm memory trim` for optimization

## Rust Ingestion Engine

### Core Responsibilities

**1. File Conversion and Processing**
- **Text files**: Direct ingestion with metadata extraction
- **PDF**: Text extraction + OCR for image-based PDFs  
- **EPUB/MOBI**: E-book parsing with metadata preservation
- **Code files**: LSP-enhanced parsing with symbol analysis
- **Web pages**: Recursive crawling from root URLs with rate limiting

**2. File Watching and Auto-Ingestion**
- **Project folders**: Automatic when MCP server active (built-in, no user config)
- **Library folders**: User-configured via `wqm watch` for specific collections
- **LSP Integration**: Auto-detect available language servers (rust-analyzer, ruff, etc.)
- **No auto-install**: User maintains control over installed language servers

**3. Metadata Workflow for Libraries**
**Incomplete Metadata Detection**:
1. Engine discovers files without complete metadata (filenames unreliable)
2. Creates YAML file in root folder with detected and required metadata fields
3. User completes metadata in YAML file
4. Engine processes files with complete metadata
5. Updates YAML with remaining incomplete files
6. Cycle continues until all files processed

**YAML Structure Example**:
```yaml
# Generated by workspace-qdrant-mcp ingestion engine
# Complete metadata for the files below and re-run ingestion

pending_files:
  - path: /library/advanced-rust.pdf
    detected_metadata:
      title: "Advanced Rust Programming"
      format: pdf
      file_size: "15.2MB"
    required_metadata:
      author: "?"
      year: "?"
      edition: "?"
      isbn: "?"
      tags: ["rust", "programming"]
      
  - path: /library/algorithms.epub
    detected_metadata:
      title: "Introduction to Algorithms" 
      format: epub
      authors: ["Thomas H. Cormen"]  # Sometimes detectable
    required_metadata:
      edition: "?"
      publisher: "?"
      year: "?"
```

**4. Document Type-Based Version Management**
```yaml
document_types:
  book:
    primary_version: "edition" 
    secondary_version: "date"
    required_metadata: ["title", "author", "edition"]
    optional_metadata: ["isbn", "publisher", "draft_status"]
    retention_policy: "latest_only"
    
  scientific_article:
    primary_version: "publication_date"
    required_metadata: ["title", "authors", "journal", "publication_date"] 
    optional_metadata: ["doi", "volume", "issue"]
    retention_policy: "latest_only"
    
  code_file:
    primary_version: "git_tag"
    secondary_version: "modification_date"
    auto_metadata: true  # From git/filesystem
    retention_policy: "current_state_only"  # Git handles history
    
  webpage:
    primary_version: "ingestion_date" 
    required_metadata: ["title", "url", "ingestion_date"]
    retention_policy: "latest_only"
```

## Version Management System

### Precedence and Conflict Resolution
- **Same Content, Different Editions**: Latest edition wins automatically
- **Code Files**: Git tag > modification date (only current working tree stored)
- **Metadata Conflicts**: User responsibility - engine validates but doesn't override
- **Format Precedence**: Research task created for PDF vs EPUB vs MOBI quality analysis
- **Storage Strategy**: Keep latest only (default), optional archive collections (`_{collection}_archive`)

### Version Detection and Relationships
```python
async def ingest_new_version(document: Document):
    # 1. Detect if new version of existing document (limited auto-detection)
    existing_versions = await find_document_versions(document.document_id)
    
    # 2. De-prioritize all existing versions  
    for version in existing_versions:
        version.is_latest = False
        version.search_priority = 0.1
    
    # 3. Set new version as latest
    document.is_latest = True
    document.search_priority = 1.0
    
    # 4. Update version chain for tracking
    if existing_versions:
        document.supersedes = [v.version_id for v in existing_versions]
```

### Version Metadata Schema
```json
{
  "document_id": "rust-book-chapter-1",
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "version_type": "semantic|timestamp|revision",
  "document_type": "book|article|code_file|webpage",
  "is_latest": true,
  "supersedes": ["rust-book-chapter-1-v2.0.0"],
  "authority_source": "git_tag|user_yaml|auto_detected|metadata_extracted",
  "source_info": {
    "git_tag": "v2.1.0",
    "git_branch": "main", 
    "file_hash": "sha256:...",
    "ingestion_date": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "yaml_batch_id": "batch_2025_01_15_001"
  }
}
```

## Research Modes - Four Search Contexts

### Search Context Hierarchy

**1. Project Collections Only**
- Search within current project's collections (`{project}-scratchbook`, `{project}-docs`)
- Fast, focused results for active development
- Default mode for development work
- Automatic project detection from current directory

**2. Single Collection**
- Target-specific collection search (`_technical-books`, `memory`, specific project)
- Library research, specific knowledge domains
- High precision results within domain
- User specifies target collection

**3. Global Collections** 
- User-configured global collections in environment/config
- Cross-project knowledge search (standards, references, shared docs)
- Broader context research across workspace
- Configurable collection list

**4. All Collections** (replaces qdrant-retrieve functionality)
- Comprehensive search across entire workspace
- Discovery across all content types and projects
- Maximum recall mode for exploratory research
- Includes archived collections if present

### Advanced Search Interface
```python
@mcp.tool()
async def research_workspace(
    query: str,
    mode: Literal["project", "collection", "global", "all"] = "project",
    target_collection: str = None,
    include_relationships: bool = False,
    version_preference: Literal["latest", "all", "specific"] = "latest",
    include_archived: bool = False
):
    """Advanced semantic research with context control and version awareness"""
```

### CLI Integration Examples
```bash
# Memory management
wqm memory add "Always use uv for Python package management"
wqm memory tokens  # Shows: Memory rules using 1,247 tokens (8.3% of context)
wqm memory trim --max-tokens 2000

# Library management with watching
wqm library create technical-books  # Creates _technical-books collection
wqm watch add /home/user/library/books --collection=_technical-books
wqm ingest yaml /home/user/library/pending_metadata.yaml

# Research across contexts
wqm search project "rust async patterns"
wqm search all "machine learning best practices" --include-relationships
wqm search memory "python preferences"  # Query the knowledge graph

# Engine lifecycle
wqm admin status  # Shows engine status, active tasks, resource usage
wqm admin restart-engine  # Apply new configuration
```

## Knowledge Graph Implementation

### Memory Collection as Knowledge Graph

**Entity Types in Memory**:
```yaml
entities:
  user_preference:
    name: "python_tooling"
    rule: "Use uv exclusively for Python package management"
    authority: "default"
    scope: ["python", "package_management"]
    
  llm_behavior:
    name: "atomic_commits" 
    rule: "Always make atomic commits following conventional format"
    authority: "absolute"
    examples: ["feat:", "fix:", "docs:", "refactor:"]
    
  agent_definition:
    name: "python-pro"
    description: "Expert Python developer"
    capabilities: ["fastapi", "async", "testing"]
    deployment_cost: "medium"
    last_used: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    
  project_context:
    name: "workspace-qdrant-mcp"
    type: "rust_migration_project"
    preferences: ["use_task_master", "atomic_commits"]
    active_agents: ["python-pro", "task-orchestrator"]
```

**Relationship Types**:
- `applies_to`: preference → project_context
- `requires`: llm_behavior → agent_definition  
- `conflicts_with`: preference → preference
- `supersedes`: rule → rule (for version management)

### Relationship Extraction (Future Enhancement)
- **NER**: Named Entity Recognition from ingested documents
- **Relation Extraction**: Transformer-based relationship identification  
- **Coreference Resolution**: Entity linking across documents
- **Vector Similarity**: Implicit relationship inference from embeddings

## Integration with Claude Code

### Session Initialization Workflow
```python
async def claude_code_startup_hook():
    """Called when Claude Code starts workspace-qdrant-mcp"""
    
    # 1. Start Rust engine with graceful lifecycle management
    engine_status = await start_rust_engine()
    
    # 2. Load memory rules from memory collection
    memory_rules = await load_memory_collection()
    
    # 3. Detect conflicts using Claude/Sonnet semantic analysis
    conflicts = await detect_memory_conflicts(memory_rules)
    
    if conflicts:
        # 4. Return conflict resolution prompt for user
        return {
            "type": "conflict_resolution",
            "message": format_conflict_prompt(conflicts),
            "conflicts": conflicts,
            "action_required": "resolve_before_session"
        }
    
    # 5. Inject clean rules into Claude Code system context
    system_rules = format_system_rules_for_injection(memory_rules)
    await claude_code_sdk.inject_system_context(system_rules)
    
    # 6. Initialize project collections based on current directory
    project_info = await detect_current_project()
    await ensure_project_collections(project_info)
    
    return {
        "type": "session_ready",
        "message": f"Loaded {len(memory_rules)} memory rules, {len(project_info.collections)} project collections",
        "engine_status": engine_status,
        "project_context": project_info
    }
```

### System Rule Injection Format
```python
def format_system_rules_for_injection(rules: List[MemoryRule]) -> str:
    """Format memory rules for Claude Code system context"""
    
    absolute_rules = [r for r in rules if r.authority == "absolute"]
    default_rules = [r for r in rules if r.authority == "default"]
    
    return f"""
# User Memory Rules (workspace-qdrant-mcp)
## Loaded {len(rules)} rules from memory collection

## Absolute Rules (always follow):
{format_rule_list(absolute_rules)}

## Default Rules (follow unless explicitly overridden by user/PRD):  
{format_rule_list(default_rules)}

## Agent Library (available for deployment):
{format_agent_library(rules)}

Note: If conflicting instructions arise during session, alert user and reference these memory rules for clarification.
Session initialized with project context: {project_context}
"""
```

## Migration and Compatibility 

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- **Natural Compatibility**: Existing collections work unless embedding model changes
- **Collection Conflicts**: Rename conflicting collections automatically (`collection` → `collection_v1`)
- **Low Priority**: Limited existing user base allows flexible migration approach
- **Migration Tools**: Optional tools for collection reorganization if needed

### Breaking Changes (Acceptable)
- **CLI Commands**: Complete restructure to unified `wqm` interface  
- **Collection Naming**: Reserved names and underscore prefix system
- **Configuration**: New configuration format for engine and memory settings
- **API Changes**: MCP tool signatures may change for enhanced functionality

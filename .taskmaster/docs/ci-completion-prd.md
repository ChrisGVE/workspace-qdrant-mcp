# CI/CD Pipeline Completion - Ad-hoc PRD

## Project Status
- **Current State**: 2/6 CI workflows passing, 93.33% core functionality complete
- **Goal**: Achieve 6/6 CI workflows passing for full project completion
- **Priority**: High - Required for production deployment

## Background
All core functionality from PRD v2.0 has been implemented successfully:
- Version-aware document management ✅
- Four-mode research interface ✅  
- Library folder watching system ✅
- Web interface for memory curation ✅
- All major features working with comprehensive tests

However, 4 CI workflows remain failing, preventing full deployment readiness.

## Objective
Fix all remaining CI workflow failures to achieve 6/6 passing status.

## Current CI Workflow Status
- ✅ Security Scanning - PASSING
- ✅ PyPI Publishing - PASSING  
- ❌ Quality Assurance - FAILING
- ❌ Documentation - FAILING
- ❌ Integration Tests - FAILING
- ❌ Performance Tests - FAILING

## Requirements

### 1. Quality Assurance Workflow Fix
**Objective**: Ensure code quality checks pass consistently
- Fix any linting issues (ruff, black, mypy)
- Ensure test coverage meets minimum thresholds
- Resolve any code quality violations
- Verify all tests pass in CI environment

### 2. Documentation Workflow Fix  
**Objective**: Ensure documentation builds and deploys properly
- Fix any Sphinx/MkDocs build issues
- Update outdated documentation
- Ensure API docs generate correctly
- Verify documentation deployment pipeline

### 3. Integration Tests Workflow Fix
**Objective**: Ensure full system integration tests pass
- Fix environment setup issues in CI
- Resolve any service dependency problems
- Ensure database connections work in CI
- Verify end-to-end workflows function

### 4. Performance Tests Workflow Fix
**Objective**: Ensure performance benchmarks execute properly
- Fix benchmark execution in CI environment
- Resolve any timeout or resource issues
- Ensure performance metrics collection works
- Verify benchmark result reporting

## Success Criteria
- All 6 CI workflows show green/passing status
- No flaky or intermittent test failures
- Consistent execution across multiple runs
- Proper error reporting for any future failures

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing functionality
- Cannot break current passing workflows
- Should minimize CI execution time
- Must work with existing CI infrastructure

## Implementation Approach
1. Analyze each failing workflow systematically
2. Identify root causes of failures
3. Implement targeted fixes
4. Test fixes in CI environment
5. Verify stability across multiple runs

## Timeline
- High priority: Complete ASAP to achieve full project completion
- Target: All workflows passing within current session

## Dependencies
- Existing CI configuration files
- Current test infrastructure
- Documentation tooling setup
- Performance testing framework

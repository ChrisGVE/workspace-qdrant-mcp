# Product Requirements Document: Polish & Production Ready

## Executive Summary

Transform workspace-qdrant-mcp from a functionally complete project into a polished, production-ready, and user-friendly open-source package. This includes comprehensive repository cleanup, enhanced user experience, complete documentation, production deployment automation, and security hardening.

## 1. Repository Cleanup & Housekeeping

### 1.1 File & Directory Cleanup
**Priority: Critical**

The repository has accumulated development artifacts and temporary files that don't belong in the main codebase.

**Requirements:**
- Remove development-specific directories: `.claude/`, `.taskmaster/`  
- Remove benchmark and test result directories: `.benchmarks/`, `benchmark_results/`, `chunk_empirical_results/`, `format_benchmark_results/`, `htmlcov/`, `performance_results/`, `recall_precision_results/`
- Remove configuration files that shouldn't be tracked: `.releaserc.json`, `.mcp.json`, `bandit-report.json`
- Evaluate and potentially remove: `.env.example` (keep if useful for users)
- Untrack but preserve `document_format_research.md` (move to .gitignore)
- Question purpose of directories: `.bandit/` and other unexpected folders

### 1.2 Git History Cleanup
**Priority: High**

Multiple commit messages contain ANSI color escape sequences that pollute the git history.

**Requirements:**
- Scan ALL commit messages for ANSI color codes (sequences like `[38;2;127;132;156m`, `[0m`)
- Use git filter-branch or git rebase to clean affected commit messages
- Ensure commit history is clean and professional
- Maintain all functional changes while cleaning presentation

### 1.3 Repository Standards

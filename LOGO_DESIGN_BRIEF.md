# workspace-qdrant-mcp Logo Design Brief

## Project Overview

**workspace-qdrant-mcp** is a project-scoped Qdrant MCP server that provides intelligent vector database operations through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables seamless integration between project workspaces and AI via vector search, featuring automatic project detection, hybrid search capabilities, and configurable collection management.

**Core Message:** "Intelligent workspace search powered by vector similarity"

## Design Concept

### Visual Narrative
The logo should tell the story of connecting project files/workspaces to AI through intelligent vector search:
- **Left**: Project workspace/files (folders, documents, code)
- **Center**: Vector search hub (similarity connections, search mechanics)
- **Right**: AI/Claude integration (intelligence, processing)

### Key Visual Elements
1. **Workspace Representation**: Geometric folders, file icons, or workspace grid
2. **Vector Search Hub**: Interconnected points, similarity vectors, or search magnification
3. **AI Connection**: Brain symbolism, neural networks, or processing indicators
4. **Flow/Connection**: Arrows, lines, or gradients showing data flow

## AI Image Generation Prompts

### Prompt 1: Abstract Vector Network
```
Create a minimalist logo for "workspace-qdrant-mcp", a vector database MCP server. Design concept: Abstract geometric representation showing project workspace files on the left connecting through a central vector search hub to AI processing on the right. Use clean lines, geometric shapes, and a flow from left to right. Color scheme: deep blue primary (#1B365D), bright teal secondary (#00BCD4), orange accent (#FF6B35). Style: minimalist, technical, professional. The logo should work on both light and dark backgrounds. Vector-friendly design suitable for scaling from favicon size to large displays.
```

### Prompt 2: Magnifying Glass + Vectors
```
Design a professional logo combining a magnifying glass over geometric vector points/nodes for "workspace-qdrant-mcp". The magnifying glass represents search functionality, while interconnected geometric points represent vector similarity matching. Include subtle workspace elements (folder icons, document symbols) flowing into the search area. Color palette: deep blue (#1B365D) for the magnifying glass, bright teal (#00BCD4) for vector points, orange (#FF6B35) for highlighting active connections. Minimalist, technical aesthetic suitable for business presentations and developer tools.
```

### Prompt 3: Data Flow Visualization
```
Create a modern logo showing data flow from workspace to AI through vector search for "workspace-qdrant-mcp". Visual elements: Left side shows stylized workspace files/folders, center shows vector similarity connections (dots connected by lines), right side shows AI brain/processing symbol. Connected by flowing arrows or gradient streams. Use geometric shapes and clean lines. Color scheme: deep blue (#1B365D), bright teal (#00BCD4), orange accent (#FF6B35). Professional, minimalist style that works across all sizes and backgrounds.
```

### Prompt 4: Hexagonal Network Hub
```
Design a logo featuring a hexagonal network pattern representing vector search connections for "workspace-qdrant-mcp". Center: hexagonal hub with interconnected nodes. Left side: workspace file symbols flowing into the hub. Right side: AI/brain iconography receiving processed data. Use geometric precision and clean lines. Color treatment: deep blue hexagons (#1B365D), teal connection lines (#00BCD4), orange highlights for active paths (#FF6B35). Technical, professional appearance suitable for software documentation and business materials.
```

### Prompt 5: Three-Section Composition
```
Create a three-panel logo design for "workspace-qdrant-mcp": Panel 1 (left) shows workspace elements (folders, files, code symbols), Panel 2 (center) shows vector search visualization (interconnected points, similarity matching), Panel 3 (right) shows AI integration (brain, processing, intelligence). Panels connected by subtle flow lines or gradients. Minimalist geometric style with color scheme: deep blue (#1B365D), bright teal (#00BCD4), orange (#FF6B35). Professional enough for enterprise presentations while remaining approachable for developers.

git commit -m "feat: Implement comprehensive multi-component communication testing for Task 80

- Add complete multi-component integration test suite in test_multi_component_communication.py
- Test cross-component state synchronization between CLI, MCP, Web UI, and SQLite
- Validate configuration consistency across all components with YAML hierarchy
- Test event propagation for file processing events visible in UI and status commands  
- Test error coordination and proper communication across all interfaces
- Monitor for communication bottlenecks and performance issues
- Extend SQLite state manager with multi-component support methods
- Add YAMLConfigLoader with environment variable substitution and hierarchy support
- Implement comprehensive test fixture for managing all components
- Cover state synchronization, configuration consistency, event propagation, error coordination, and performance monitoring

Task 80 completion: Cross-component integration testing validates seamless communication
and state synchronization across CLI commands, MCP server tools, Web UI interface, 
and SQLite state manager with comprehensive error handling and performance monitoring."

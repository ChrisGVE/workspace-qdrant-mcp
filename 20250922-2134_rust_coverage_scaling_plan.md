# Rust Coverage Scaling Plan: 34.32% → 100%

## Current Status (Baseline Measurement)
**Overall Coverage: 34.32% lines (3,031/8,831), 29.58% functions (934/3,158)**

### Module Breakdown:
- **src/daemon**: 100% lines (844/844), 54.7% functions (314/574) ✅
- **src/grpc**: 82.17% lines (613/746), 45.08% functions (188/417) ⚠️
- **src/config**: 96.93% lines (506/522), 54.55% functions (66/121) ✅
- **src/error**: 98.13% lines (157/160) ✅
- **tests/**: 0% coverage - external test files not covered ❌

### Test Status:
- **Passing tests**: 118 ✅
- **Failing tests**: 83 ❌
- **Total tests**: 201

## Systematic Coverage Scaling Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Failing Tests (Immediate Impact)
**Target: +10-15% coverage by fixing 83 failing tests**

Priority order:
1. **grpc::server tests** (10 failures) - Core infrastructure
2. **grpc::services tests** (60+ failures) - Service implementations
3. **daemon tests** (remaining failures) - Already mostly fixed

Expected improvement: 45% → 60% coverage

### Phase 2: Function Coverage Improvement (High Impact)
**Target: +20-25% coverage by testing uncovered functions**

Focus areas:
1. **src/daemon**: 314/574 functions covered (45.3% gap)
2. **src/grpc**: 188/417 functions covered (54.9% gap)
3. **src/config**: 66/121 functions covered (45.5% gap)

Strategy: Add unit tests for uncovered public and internal functions

### Phase 3: Line Coverage Completion (Final Push)
**Target: +10-15% coverage completing line coverage**

Focus areas:
1. **src/grpc**: 613/746 lines covered (17.8% gap)
2. **src/config**: 506/522 lines covered (3% gap)
3. **src/error**: 157/160 lines covered (1.9% gap)

### Phase 4: Edge Cases and Error Paths (Quality)
**Target: +5-10% coverage for comprehensive testing**

Focus areas:
1. Error handling paths
2. Edge case scenarios
3. Integration test coverage
4. Performance test coverage

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix Database-Related Test Failures
✅ **COMPLETED**: Fixed in-memory database configuration

### Step 2: Fix Arc Comparison Test Failures
✅ **COMPLETED**: Fixed test_daemon_processor_access

### Step 3: Identify and Fix gRPC Service Test Failures
- Analyze error patterns in grpc::services tests
- Fix mock/dependency injection issues
- Enable service-level testing

### Step 4: Implement Missing Function Tests
- Generate tests for uncovered public functions
- Add tests for private functions with complex logic
- Ensure all error paths are tested

### Step 5: Integration Testing
- End-to-end workflow tests
- Cross-module interaction tests
- Performance and stress tests

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Targets by Phase:
- **Phase 1 Complete**: 60% overall coverage
- **Phase 2 Complete**: 80% overall coverage
- **Phase 3 Complete**: 95% overall coverage
- **Phase 4 Complete**: 100% overall coverage

### Quality Metrics:
- All 201 tests passing
- Zero panics in test execution
- Complete error path coverage
- Integration test coverage for critical workflows

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Analyze and fix gRPC server test failures
2. **Short-term**: Implement missing function tests for daemon module
3. **Medium-term**: Complete gRPC services test coverage
4. **Long-term**: Achieve and maintain 100% coverage

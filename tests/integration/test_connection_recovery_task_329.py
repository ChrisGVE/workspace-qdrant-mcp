"""
Integration tests for connection loss recovery (Task 329.7).

Tests automatic reconnection, state synchronization, and operation retry after
network interruptions between MCP server, daemon, and Qdrant.

Test Coverage:
- Network interruption simulation (daemon <-> Qdrant, MCP <-> daemon)
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Pending operation retry after reconnection
- SQLite state consistency during connection loss
- Connection pool recovery
- Graceful transient network issue handling
- Recovery metrics and monitoring

Requirements:
- Docker and Docker Compose for service orchestration
- Integration test environment (docker/integration-tests/docker-compose.yml)

"""
Integration tests for CLI command atomicity verification (Task 330.6).

Tests that CLI commands complete atomically and handle interruptions properly:
- Command interruption scenarios (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- Partial operation handling
- State consistency after failures
- Rollback behavior verification

These tests verify:
1. Commands either complete fully or fail cleanly
2. No inconsistent state after interruptions
3. Proper cleanup on command failure
4. Transaction-like behavior for multi-step operations

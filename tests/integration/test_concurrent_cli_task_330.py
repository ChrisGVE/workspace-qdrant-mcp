"""
Integration tests for concurrent CLI operations (Task 330.5).

Tests multiple CLI instances operating simultaneously:
- Concurrent CLI commands against daemon
- Multiple ingestion requests in parallel
- Simultaneous status queries
- SQLite WAL mode handling concurrent access
- Race condition detection
- Atomic operation completion

These tests verify:
1. Multiple CLI instances can operate safely
2. SQLite WAL mode handles concurrent access correctly
3. No race conditions occur with shared resources
4. Operations complete atomically even under concurrency
5. System remains stable with high concurrent load

"""
Real-Time File Watching Integration Tests (Task 329.4).

Comprehensive integration tests for file watching functionality. Tests daemon
detection of file changes, automatic ingestion, SQLite state updates, and
immediate search availability via MCP.

Test Coverage (Task 329.4):
1. File creation detection and automatic ingestion
2. File modification detection and re-ingestion
3. File deletion handling and cleanup
4. Watch pattern matching (*.py, *.md, etc.)
5. SQLite state updates and watch configuration
6. Ingestion queue processing
7. Search reflects new/updated content immediately
8. Different file types (code, docs, config)
9. Debounce handling for rapid changes

"""
Integration tests for conflicting operations handling (Task 329.8).

Tests system behavior during concurrent conflicting operations including
concurrent writes, file watching conflicts, SQLite ACID compliance, and
collection lifecycle during active ingestion.

Test Coverage:
- Concurrent write operations to same collection/document
- Simultaneous file watching and manual ingestion of same files
- SQLite transaction handling and ACID compliance
- Collection creation/deletion during active ingestion
- Race condition handling
- Conflict resolution strategies

Requirements:
- Docker and Docker Compose for service orchestration
- Integration test environment (docker/integration-tests/docker-compose.yml)

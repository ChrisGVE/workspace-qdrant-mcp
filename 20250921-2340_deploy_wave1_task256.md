## TASK ASSIGNMENT FOR DISTRIBUTED-SYSTEMS-ARCHITECT

üìã **TASK ID**: 256
üéØ **OBJECTIVE**: Create gRPC Communication Layer
‚ö° **PRIORITY**: HIGH | üîß **COMPLEXITY**: 7/10

### MISSION BRIEFING

You are tasked with implementing production-ready gRPC communication between the Rust daemon and Python MCP server components. This is a **HIGH PRIORITY** task that forms the backbone of the four-component architecture.

### üéØ KEY DELIVERABLES

1. **gRPC Service Definitions**
   - Create .proto files for daemon-MCP communication
   - Define message formats for file processing, search, status updates
   - Include error reporting and health check protocols

2. **Connection Management**
   - Implement connection pooling with configurable pool size
   - Add automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Handle connection timeouts and retry logic

3. **Production Features**
   - Message serialization with compression support
   - Security considerations for local communication
   - Performance monitoring and metrics collection
   - Error handling with detailed logging

4. **Integration Points**
   - Rust daemon gRPC server implementation
   - Python MCP client stubs and connection handling
   - Health checking integration with existing monitoring
   - Coordination with SQLite state management (Task 257)

### üìê SCOPE BOUNDARIES

**DO FOCUS ON**:
- gRPC protocol design and implementation
- Connection reliability and error handling
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Clean integration with existing architectures

**DO NOT MODIFY**:
- Rust daemon core processing logic
- Python MCP server main architecture
- Existing client.py or server.py core functionality
- Database schemas (Task 257 handles SQLite)

### üîÑ EXECUTION PROCESS

1. **Initialize**
   ```bash
   task-master get_task --id=256 --projectRoot=/Users/chris/Dropbox/dev/ai/claude-code-cfg/mcp/workspace-qdrant-mcp
   ```

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Use `sequential-thinking` to break down gRPC implementation
   - Read existing codebase patterns for Rust daemon and Python MCP
   - Analyze current communication mechanisms to understand integration points

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Create .proto service definitions
   - Implement Rust gRPC server in daemon
   - Build Python gRPC client stubs
   - Add connection management and health checking
   - Integrate with existing monitoring infrastructure

4. **Testing Phase**
   - Unit tests for gRPC service methods
   - Integration tests for daemon-MCP communication
   - Connection reliability testing (network issues, timeouts)
   - Performance testing under load

5. **Documentation Phase**
   - Update task-master with implementation progress
   - Document gRPC API and usage patterns
   - Create troubleshooting guide for connection issues

### üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Task Management**
   - Use `task-master update_task --id=256 --prompt="progress updates"` regularly
   - Do NOT use `task-master set_task_status --id=256 --status=done` until 100% complete

2. **Development Standards**
   - Use `sequential-thinking` for all complex design decisions
   - Make atomic commits following git discipline
   - Read 2000+ lines of context before modifying code
   - Test every change comprehensively

3. **Coordination**
   - Coordinate with Task 257 (SQLite) for state management integration
   - Ensure gRPC health checks integrate with existing health monitoring
   - Design for future LSP integration (Task 255) requirements

4. **Quality Gates**
   - 100% test coverage for gRPC functionality
   - Performance benchmarks for message throughput
   - Reliability testing for connection failures
   - Complete documentation for API usage

### üîß TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

**gRPC Services Required**:
- `DocumentProcessingService` - File ingestion and processing requests
- `SearchService` - Hybrid search and query operations
- `StateService` - Component status and health reporting
- `AdminService` - Collection management and administration

**Message Types**:
- Document processing requests/responses
- Search queries and results
- Health check requests/responses
- Error reporting with detailed context

**Connection Requirements**:
- Local Unix socket or TCP localhost communication
- Connection pooling (default: 5 connections)
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Request timeout: 30 seconds default, configurable
- Compression: gzip compression for large responses

**Performance Targets**:
- Message throughput: 1000+ messages/second
- Connection establishment: <100ms
- Request latency: <10ms for simple operations
- Memory usage: <50MB for connection pool

## BEGIN EXECUTION

Execute this task with full focus and systematic approach. The gRPC communication layer is critical infrastructure that enables the entire four-component architecture.

**START COMMAND**:
```bash
task-master get_task --id=256 --projectRoot=/Users/chris/Dropbox/dev/ai/claude-code-cfg/mcp/workspace-qdrant-mcp
```

**REMINDER**: Do NOT mark this task as done until the orchestrator has verified 100% completion and integration testing is successful.

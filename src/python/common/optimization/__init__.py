"""
FastMCP Optimization Module

This module provides enhanced FastMCP framework integration with optimizations:
- Lazy tool loading and efficient registration
- Stdio protocol compression and batching  
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Streaming response support
- Memory usage optimization

The optimizations are designed to improve:
1. Server startup time (lazy loading)
2. Communication efficiency (compression, batching)  
3. Memory usage (efficient tool management)
4. Large response handling (streaming)
5. Performance monitoring (built-in metrics)

## Test Sequences Executed

### Sequence 1: Fresh Installation Workflow
**Scenario:** Clean system with no existing daemon installation

```bash
# Test Commands (in order)
1. uv run wqm service status          # Initial status check
2. uv run wqm service install         # Fresh install  
3. uv run wqm service status          # Status after install
4. uv run wqm service start           # Start after install
5. uv run wqm service status          # Status after start
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Status should show "not installed" or "not running"
2. Install should succeed with confirmation message
3. Status should show "installed but not running" 
4. Start should succeed and launch daemon process
5. Status should show "running" with process details

**Actual Results:** *(Results from testing execution)*
- **Status check fails** with unclear error messages
- **Install command** encounters path resolution issues
- **Process detection** unreliable after start command
- **Status inconsistency** between reported state and actual processes

---

### Sequence 2: Service Control Operations
**Scenario:** Service installed and running, test control commands

```bash  
# Test Commands (in order)
1. uv run wqm service stop            # Stop running service
2. uv run wqm service status          # Status after stop
3. uv run wqm service restart         # Restart when stopped
4. uv run wqm service status          # Status after restart
```

**Critical Issues Identified:**
- **Stop command** doesn't always terminate memexd processes completely
- **Status command** shows conflicting information vs actual process state
- **Restart command** fails when service is actually stopped
- **Process state detection** unreliable using `ps aux | grep memexd`

---

### Sequence 3: Error Condition Testing
**Scenario:** Test command behavior in invalid states

```bash
# Error Condition Tests
1. uv run wqm service start           # Start when already running
2. uv run wqm service install         # Install when already installed  
3. uv run wqm service stop            # Stop when not running
4. uv run wqm service uninstall       # Uninstall when running
5. uv run wqm service start           # Start when not installed
```

**Error Handling Issues:**
- **Duplicate operations** don't provide clear feedback
- **Invalid state transitions** cause confusing error messages
- **Exit codes** inconsistent across error conditions
- **Error messages** lack actionable guidance for users

---

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Process State Detection Problems
**Issue:** Inconsistent detection of memexd daemon processes
- Status command reports "stopped" while memexd processes are actually running
- `ps aux | grep memexd` shows processes that service commands don't recognize
- Process cleanup incomplete after stop commands

**Impact:** High - Users cannot reliably determine service state

**Recommended Fix:** 
- Implement robust PID file management
- Add process validation to all service commands
- Improve process cleanup in stop command

### 2. Installation Path Issues  
**Issue:** Service installation encounters path resolution problems
- Install command fails to locate daemon binary consistently
- Binary path hardcoded or not properly resolved for different environments
- Installation doesn't validate binary existence before proceeding

**Impact:** High - Fresh installations fail

**Recommended Fix:**
- Add binary location validation
- Implement flexible path resolution
- Provide clear error messages for missing binaries

### 3. Status Command Unreliability
**Issue:** Status reporting doesn't match actual system state
- Reports "not running" when processes are active
- Inconsistent output format across different states
- Missing process details (PID, uptime, etc.)

**Impact:** Medium - Users get incorrect service state information

**Recommended Fix:**
- Implement comprehensive status checking
- Standardize status output format
- Add process details (PID, memory usage, uptime)

### 4. Error Message Quality
**Issue:** Poor error messages don't help users resolve issues
- Generic error messages without context
- Missing guidance for resolving common problems
- Inconsistent error codes across similar failures

**Impact:** Medium - Poor user experience during troubleshooting

**Recommended Fix:**
- Add contextual error messages
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
- Standardize exit codes

## Command-Specific Issues

### `wqm service install`
- **Issue:** Binary path resolution fails
- **Error:** "memexd binary not found" or similar path errors
- **Exit Code:** Non-zero but inconsistent
- **Frequency:** High on fresh systems

### `wqm service start` 
- **Issue:** Doesn't detect if already running
- **Error:** May start duplicate processes
- **Exit Code:** 0 (success) even when problematic
- **Frequency:** Medium during repeated testing

### `wqm service status`
- **Issue:** Inaccurate process state reporting  
- **Error:** Shows "stopped" when memexd processes exist
- **Exit Code:** 0 but misleading output
- **Frequency:** High - consistently unreliable

### `wqm service stop`
- **Issue:** Incomplete process termination
- **Error:** Some memexd processes remain after stop
- **Exit Code:** 0 (reports success) despite incomplete cleanup
- **Frequency:** Medium - inconsistent cleanup

### `wqm service restart`
- **Issue:** Fails when service is actually stopped
- **Error:** "Cannot restart stopped service" even when processes exist
- **Exit Code:** Non-zero failure  
- **Frequency:** High during state transition testing

### `wqm service uninstall`
- **Issue:** Doesn't clean up all installation artifacts
- **Error:** Service files or configurations remain  
- **Exit Code:** 0 but incomplete cleanup
- **Frequency:** Low but creates system pollution

## Edge Case Analysis

### Double Operations
- **Double Install:** Should detect existing installation and skip or update
- **Double Start:** Should detect running process and either succeed silently or inform user
- **Double Stop:** Should handle gracefully when already stopped
- **Double Uninstall:** Should detect and handle non-existent installation

### State Transition Problems
- **Install → Start:** Should work reliably
- **Start → Stop:** Should completely terminate processes  
- **Stop → Restart:** Should start fresh instead of failing
- **Running → Uninstall:** Should stop first or warn user

### Process Management Issues
- **Orphaned Processes:** memexd processes remain after stop
- **PID Tracking:** No reliable PID file management
- **Resource Cleanup:** Temporary files and sockets not cleaned up
- **Permission Issues:** Service operations may fail due to file permissions

---

## Recommendations for Fixes

### High Priority
1. **Fix Process Detection** - Implement reliable PID file management
2. **Resolve Installation Issues** - Add binary validation and flexible path resolution
3. **Improve Status Accuracy** - Make status command reflect actual process state
4. **Complete Process Cleanup** - Ensure stop command terminates all processes

### Medium Priority  
1. **Enhance Error Messages** - Provide actionable guidance in error conditions
2. **Standardize Exit Codes** - Use consistent codes across similar operations
3. **Add Process Details** - Include PID, uptime, memory usage in status output
4. **Improve State Transitions** - Handle edge cases in command sequences

### Low Priority
1. **Add Validation** - Pre-flight checks before executing commands
2. **Implement Logging** - Service operation logging for troubleshooting
3. **Add Configuration** - Allow customization of daemon settings
4. **Improve Documentation** - Clear guidance for service management

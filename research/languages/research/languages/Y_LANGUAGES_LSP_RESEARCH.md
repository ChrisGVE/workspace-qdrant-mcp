# Y Languages LSP Research Report

## Executive Summary

Research conducted on 3 programming languages beginning with "Y" from Wikipedia's List of Programming Languages. Analysis focused on Language Server Protocol (LSP) support, file signatures, installation methods, and development status. The Y category contains fewer languages compared to other letters, with YAML being the standout language with excellent LSP support, while YASS and Yorick represent more specialized domains with limited modern tooling.

**Key Findings:**
- **Excellent LSP Support**: YAML (Red Hat YAML Language Server)
- **Specialized Scientific Computing**: Yorick (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory)
- **Limited Information**: YASS (insufficient public documentation)
- **Strong Tree-sitter Support**: YAML has comprehensive grammar support

#       "url": "https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server",
#       "highlightingModeRegex": "^YAML$"
#     }
#   }
# }
```

**Evaluation:**
- Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Highly optimized for large YAML files)
- Project Scope: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Universal configuration language)

- Auto-discovery of schemas from SchemaStore.org
- Custom schema configuration support
- Real-time validation and error reporting
- Formatting and document outline
- Hover documentation
- Custom tag support for application-specific YAML

**Tree-sitter Grammar:**
- Available: [ikatyang/tree-sitter-yaml](https://github.com/ikatyang/tree-sitter-yaml)
- Status: Mature and well-maintained
- Features: Complete YAML syntax support with proper indentation handling

**Recommendation:** Primary Choice - Excellent LSP support with comprehensive features

### 2. YASS (Yet Another Scripting Solution)

**File Signatures:**
- Extensions: Unknown (insufficient documentation)
- Content patterns: Unknown (limited public information)
- Source URL: Limited public documentation available

**LSP Servers:**
- Name: None found
- Repository: N/A
- Official Status: No LSP implementation found
- LSP Compliance: ⭐ (No LSP support identified)

**Installation:**
```bash
# No standard installation method identified
# Limited public documentation available
```

**Evaluation:**
- Speed: Unknown (insufficient data)
- Project Scope: ⭐ (Limited public adoption)
- Feature Completeness: ⭐ (No modern tooling identified)
- Active Development: ⭐ (No recent activity found)
- LSP Standard Compliance: ⭐ (No LSP support)

**Tree-sitter Grammar:** Not Available

**Recommendation:** No Viable LSP - Insufficient documentation and tooling

**Research Notes:**
YASS appears to be either a very specialized or historical scripting language with limited public documentation. No official repositories, documentation sites, or development tools were found during research. This may be an internal or proprietary scripting solution that hasn't gained public adoption or may be a deprecated project.

### 3. Yorick (Scientific Computing Language)

**File Signatures:**
- Extensions: `.i` (include/library files), `.yorick`
- Content patterns: C-like syntax, array operations, `func` keyword for functions
- Content signatures:
  - `#include` directives
  - Array manipulation syntax: `array(double, 10, 10)`
  - FITS file operations
  - Graphics function calls
- Source URL: [Yorick Official Site](https://yorick.sourceforge.net/)

**LSP Servers:**
- Name: None found
- Repository: N/A
- Official Status: No LSP implementation
- LSP Compliance: ⭐ (No LSP support)

**Installation:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install yorick yorick-dev

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install yorick

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install yorick yorick-devel

# From source
git clone https://github.com/LLNL/yorick.git
cd yorick
make config
make
make install

# FreeBSD
pkg install yorick
```

**Evaluation:**
- Speed: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Optimized for large array operations)
- Project Scope: ⭐⭐⭐ (Scientific computing and simulations)
- Feature Completeness: ⭐⭐ (Basic interpreter, no LSP tooling)
- Active Development: ⭐⭐ (Maintenance mode, LLNL support)
- LSP Standard Compliance: ⭐ (No LSP support)

**Key Features:**
- Fast array operations with C-like syntax
- Interactive graphics with GIST graphics library
- Binary file I/O optimized for scientific data
- FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) file support
- Cross-platform compatibility (Unix, Windows, macOS)
- Extensible via C or Fortran routines
- Dynamic scoping similar to Lisp dialects

**Development Tools:**
- Interactive interpreter with command-line interface
- Basic syntax highlighting in some editors (vim, emacs)
- Graphics output to X11, PostScript, PDF
- Debugger integrated into interpreter

**Tree-sitter Grammar:** Not Available

**Recommendation:** No Viable LSP - Specialized scientific language with basic tooling

**Research Notes:**
Yorick was developed by David H. Munro at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 1996 for scientific computing applications. While it has a dedicated user base in scientific computing, particularly for astronomical data analysis and physics simulations, it lacks modern development tooling including LSP support. The language is maintained but not actively developed with new features.

## Summary and Recommendations

### Primary Choice Languages (Excellent LSP Support):
1. **YAML** - Red Hat YAML Language Server provides comprehensive support with schema validation, completion, and formatting

### No Viable LSP Languages:
1. **YASS** - Insufficient public documentation and no identifiable tooling
2. **Yorick** - Specialized scientific computing language with basic interpreter only

### Key Insights:

**YAML Dominance:**
- YAML represents the only Y language with modern, comprehensive LSP support
- Red Hat's YAML Language Server is considered one of the best LSP implementations
- Wide adoption across DevOps, configuration management, and cloud-native applications
- Excellent schema integration supporting Kubernetes, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, and more

**Scientific Computing Gap:**
- Yorick represents a significant gap in LSP support for scientific computing languages
- Despite being actively used in scientific communities, lacks modern development tooling
- Could benefit from community-driven LSP development given its specialized use cases

**Limited Y Language Ecosystem:**
- The Y category has fewer languages compared to other letters
- Most Y languages are either highly specialized (Yorick) or have limited documentation (YASS)
- YAML's success demonstrates the importance of strong tooling for language adoption

### Installation Priority:

1. **Essential**: Install Red Hat YAML Language Server for any development involving configuration files, CI/CD, or cloud-native applications
2. **Optional**: Consider basic syntax highlighting for Yorick if working in scientific computing environments
3. **Skip**: YASS due to lack of available tooling and documentation

### Editor Recommendations:

**For YAML Development:**
- **VS Code**: Red Hat YAML extension (recommended)
- **Neovim**: yaml-language-server via Mason
- **Emacs**: LSP Mode with yamlls
- **Sublime Text**: LSP-yaml package

**For Yorick Development:**
- Basic text editors with C-style syntax highlighting
- Interactive Yorick interpreter for development and testing
- Consider vim or emacs with basic Yorick syntax files if available

### Schema Integration:
YAML Language Server's automatic schema detection from SchemaStore.org provides validation for:
- Kubernetes manifests
- Docker Compose files
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Azure Pipelines
- Ansible playbooks
- OpenAPI specifications
- And 400+ other schema types

This makes YAML development significantly more productive and error-free compared to basic text editing.

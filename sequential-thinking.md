# Sequential Thinking: Systematic CLI Runtime Error Fixing

## Phase 1: Analysis and Discovery

1. **Identify CLI command structure**
   - Find all CLI command files in src/ directory
   - Map out the command hierarchy (memory, admin, ingest, search, library, watch, observability)
   
2. **Audit console.logger usage**
   - Search for all instances of `console.logger` across CLI files
   - Document which files have the issue
   - Understand the intended logging pattern

3. **Identify missing client methods**
   - Find references to missing methods like 'scroll'
   - Document which commands try to use non-existent methods

## Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis

1. **Console object structure**
   - Examine what Console class actually provides
   - Determine correct logging approach
   - Check if Rich Console is being used correctly

2. **Client method availability**
   - Review QdrantClient class to see available methods
   - Identify which methods are missing vs incorrectly referenced

## Phase 3: Systematic Fixes

1. **Fix logging approach**
   - Replace console.logger.info() with proper Rich Console methods
   - Use console.print() for output instead
   - Implement consistent error handling

2. **Fix missing client methods**
   - Either implement missing methods or handle gracefully
   - Add proper error messages for unavailable functionality

3. **Error handling consistency**
   - Ensure all commands have proper try/catch blocks
   - Provide clear, simple error messages
   - Handle connection failures gracefully

## Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing

1. **Test all subcommands systematically**
   - memory: list, add, edit, remove, tokens, trim, conflicts, parse, web
   - admin: status, config, start-engine, stop-engine, restart-engine, collections, health
   - ingest: file, folder, yaml, generate-yaml, web, status
   - search: project, collection, global, all, memory, research
   - library: list, create, remove, status, info, rename, copy
   - watch: add, list, remove, status, pause, resume, sync
   - observability: health, metrics, diagnostics, monitor

2. **Verify fixes work**
   - Each command either works correctly or shows clear error
   - No more AttributeError exceptions
   - Consistent behavior across all commands

## Phase 5: Commit and Validate

1. **Make atomic commits for each fix**
   - One commit per command group fixed
   - Clear commit messages describing the fix

2. **Final validation**
   - Run complete test suite
   - Verify no regression in working commands
   - Document any remaining limitations

## Key Principles:
- Fix root causes, not symptoms
- Maintain consistent patterns across all commands
- Simple, clear error messages
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

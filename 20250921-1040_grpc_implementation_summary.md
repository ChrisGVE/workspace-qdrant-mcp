## Technical Implementation Details

### gRPC Service Definition

**Proto file:** `src/rust/daemon/proto/ingestion.proto`

The gRPC service implements comprehensive document processing and system monitoring capabilities:

- `ProcessDocument` - Document ingestion with metadata
- `ExecuteQuery` - Hybrid search query execution  
- `HealthCheck` - Multi-component health validation
- `StartWatching` - File system monitoring
- `GetStats` - Performance metrics collection
- `StreamProcessingStatus` - Real-time processing updates

### Authentication Flow

1. Client includes `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>` header
2. Server validates API key against configured value
3. Origin header validated against allowed origins list
4. TLS certificate validation (if mutual TLS enabled)
5. Request proceeds or rejected with appropriate error code

### Connection Pool Management

1. Pool initialized with configurable connection count
2. Connections marked as in-use during requests
3. Health checks maintain connection viability
4. Idle connections cleaned up after timeout
5. Pool scales up to maximum size under load

### Circuit Breaker Operation

- **Closed State:** Normal operation, requests flow through
- **Open State:** Fast-fail after failure threshold reached
- **Half-Open State:** Test requests allowed after timeout
- **Recovery:** Automatic transition back to closed on success

## Recommendations

### Performance Optimization
1. **Increase Throughput:** Current 40 req/s is adequate but could be improved through:
   - Connection pool size optimization
   - Request batching implementation
   - Async processing pipeline enhancements

2. **Latency Reduction:** 15.5ms average latency could be reduced through:
   - Connection keepalive tuning
   - Message serialization optimization
   - Network buffer size adjustment

### Security Enhancements
1. **Rate Limiting:** Implement request rate limiting per client
2. **JWT Tokens:** Full JWT token validation implementation
3. **Certificate Rotation:** Automatic certificate renewal support

### Monitoring Improvements
1. **Distributed Tracing:** Add OpenTelemetry tracing support
2. **Metrics Export:** Prometheus metrics endpoint
3. **Alerting Integration:** Webhook-based alerting system

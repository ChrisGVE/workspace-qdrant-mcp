    result = await process_documents(files)
    trace.add_metric(MetricType.FILE_PROCESSING_RATE, rate, "files/min")
```

### **Alert Handling**
```python
def handle_performance_alert(alert: PerformanceAlert):
    if alert.severity == "critical":
        # Immediate action required
        logger.critical(f"Critical performance issue: {alert.message}")
        # Apply auto-optimizations if available
        if alert.auto_actionable:
            asyncio.create_task(apply_optimization(alert.recommendations[0]))

performance_monitor.add_alert_callback(handle_performance_alert)
```

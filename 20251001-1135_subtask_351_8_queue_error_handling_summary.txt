Subtask 351.8: Queue Error Handling Implementation Summary
===========================================================

Date: 2025-10-01 11:35
Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE - User has made significant progress

## Current State of Implementation

### What Has Been Completed:

1. **File Watcher Integration with State Manager** ✅
   - File watcher (file_watcher.py) has been modified to directly use SQLiteStateManager
   - Removed callback-based architecture in favor of direct queue operations
   - Added `_trigger_operation` method that enqueues files directly (lines 532-589)
   - Basic try-except error handling in place

2. **Error Handling Infrastructure** ✅
   - Comprehensive error handler already exists: queue_error_handler.py
   - Implements error classification, retry strategies, circuit breaker
   - Support for ErrorCategory (Transient, Permanent, RateLimit, Resource)
   - ErrorType enum with 16 specific error types and categorization
   - RetryConfig with exponential backoff and jitter
   - CircuitBreakerConfig and state management
   - ErrorMetrics for monitoring

3. **Test Suite** ✅
   - Created comprehensive test file: test_file_watcher_queue_error_handling.py
   - Tests cover:
     * Database locked errors with retry
     * Validation errors without retry
     * Runtime errors
     * Generic exceptions
     * Error statistics tracking
     * Watcher resilience
     * Circuit breaker pattern

### What Remains To Be Done:

1. **Enhance FileWatcher Class** ❌
   - Add QueueErrorStatistics dataclass to track errors
   - Add error_stats instance variable to FileWatcher.__init__
   - Add configuration parameters for retry logic:
     * max_retries (default: 3)
     * backoff_base (default: 1.0s)
     * backoff_max (default: 30.0s)
     * circuit_breaker_threshold (default: 10)
     * circuit_breaker_reset_timeout (default: 60.0s)

2. **Implement Retry Logic in _trigger_operation** ❌
   Current implementation (lines 532-589):
   ```python
   try:
       # ... detection and enqueue logic ...
       queue_id = await self.state_manager.enqueue(...)
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Error enqueueing file {file_path} for {operation}: {e}")
       raise
   ```

   Needs to become:
   ```python
   for attempt in range(self.config.max_retries + 1):
       try:
           # ... detection and enqueue logic ...
           queue_id = await self.state_manager.enqueue(...)
           # Success - update stats and return
           break
       except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
           # Handle database locked with retry
       except ValueError as e:
           # Handle validation errors (no retry)
       except RuntimeError as e:
           # Handle state manager not initialized
       except Exception as e:
           # Generic fallback
   ```

3. **Add Helper Methods to FileWatcher** ❌
   - `_calculate_backoff(attempt: int) -> float`
     * Exponential backoff with jitter
     * Use config.backoff_base, backoff_max
   - `_check_circuit_breaker() -> bool`
     * Check if consecutive failures exceed threshold
     * Check if reset timeout has elapsed
   - `_trip_circuit_breaker()`
     * Set circuit breaker state to open
     * Record timestamp
   - `_reset_circuit_breaker()`
     * Clear circuit breaker state after success
   - `_record_failure(file_path, collection, operation, error)`
     * Update error statistics
     * Increment consecutive failures
     * Log with full context

4. **Add Statistics Methods** ❌
   - `get_error_statistics() -> Dict[str, Any]`
   - `reset_error_statistics()`
   - Update WatchManager to include error stats in:
     * `get_watch_status()`
     * Add `get_all_error_statistics()`
     * Add `reset_all_error_statistics()`

5. **Update WatchConfiguration Dataclass** ❌
   Add fields to WatchConfiguration:
   ```python
   # Queue error handling configuration
   max_retries: int = 3
   backoff_base: float = 1.0  # Base delay in seconds
   backoff_max: float = 30.0  # Maximum delay
   circuit_breaker_threshold: int = 10  # Consecutive failures to trip
   circuit_breaker_reset_timeout: float = 60.0  # Seconds before reset
   ```

## Implementation Strategy

Since the user has made significant modifications to file_watcher.py, we need to:

1. Read the current file completely
2. Add QueueErrorStatistics dataclass at the top (after imports)
3. Update WatchConfiguration to include error handling config
4. Add error_stats to FileWatcher.__init__
5. Replace _trigger_operation method with retry logic version
6. Add helper methods for backoff, circuit breaker, failure recording
7. Add get_error_statistics and reset_error_statistics methods
8. Update WatchManager methods to include error statistics

## Key Requirements from Task Description

✅ Wrap all state_manager.enqueue() calls in try-except blocks
❌ Handle specific errors:
   - sqlite3.OperationalError (database locked, etc.)
   - ValueError (invalid priority, validation errors)
   - RuntimeError (state manager not initialized)
   - Generic Exception as fallback

❌ Implement fallback strategies:
   - Log error with full context (file, collection, operation)
   - Increment error counter in config
   - Continue watching (don't crash watcher)
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff (max 3 retries)

❌ Add error statistics to watch config
❌ Expose errors through get_statistics() method

✅ File watcher must never crash due to queue errors (basic protection in place)
❌ Clear error messages with actionable information (needs enhancement)
❌ Statistics tracking for monitoring (needs implementation)
❌ Circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures (needs implementation)

## Files Modified/Created

Created:
- tests/unit/test_file_watcher_queue_error_handling.py

Needs Modification:
- src/python/common/core/file_watcher.py

Already Exists (no changes needed):
- src/python/common/core/queue_error_handler.py

## Next Steps

1. Carefully read entire file_watcher.py to understand user's modifications
2. Add QueueErrorStatistics and config fields
3. Enhance _trigger_operation with full retry logic
4. Add all helper methods
5. Test the implementation
6. Verify file watcher never crashes
7. Mark subtask as complete

## Notes

- User has already made significant architectural changes
- Current basic error handling exists but needs enhancement
- Must preserve user's recent work (operation type detection, etc.)
- Should use existing queue_error_handler.py patterns for consistency
- Test file is comprehensive and should guide implementation

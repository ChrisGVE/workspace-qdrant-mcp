# Performance Benchmarks CI Workflow - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Path Resolution (Commit: ede286b)
**Problem**: The benchmark script couldn't import project modules
**Error**: `❌ Import error: No module named 'src'`
**Root Cause**: Incorrect path calculation in `dev/benchmarks/tools/authoritative_benchmark.py`
**Solution**: 
- Fixed path traversal from `parent.parent.parent` to `parent.parent.parent.parent` 
- File structure: `tools` → `benchmarks` → `dev` → `workspace-qdrant-mcp`
- Now correctly resolves to project root for imports

### 2. Qdrant Health Check Endpoint (Commit: f4a6ce4)
**Problem**: Health check failed with 404 error
**Error**: `curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404`
**Root Cause**: Wrong health endpoint `/health` instead of `/healthz`
**Solution**: 
- Updated both comprehensive and large-scale benchmarks
- Changed from `http://localhost:6333/health` to `http://localhost:6333/healthz`
- Matches Qdrant v1.7.0+ API specification

### 3. Async/Await Mismatch (Commit: 4fafb94)
**Problem**: Runtime error during collection listing
**Error**: `object list can't be used in 'await' expression`
**Root Cause**: `list_workspace_collections()` is synchronous but was being awaited
**Solution**:
- Removed incorrect `await` from `client.py:260`
- Fixed docstring examples showing wrong async usage
- Method properly returns list synchronously

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- ❌ Simple Benchmark: Failed with import errors
- ❌ Comprehensive Benchmark: Failed with Qdrant health check
- ❌ Runtime: Async/await exceptions during execution

### After Fixes
- ✅ Import resolution: All modules load correctly
- ✅ Qdrant connectivity: Health checks pass with `/healthz`
- ✅ Runtime execution: No async/await errors
- ✅ Benchmark completion: Script runs to completion with proper reporting

## CI Workflow Status

The Performance Benchmarks workflow now handles:
1. **Simple Benchmark**: Runs without OSS projects for fast feedback
2. **Comprehensive Benchmark**: Tests with Qdrant service container
3. **Large Scale Benchmark**: Scheduled/manual runs with memory profiling

### Expected CI Output
- Simple benchmark produces parseable output for validation
- Health checks succeed within 60-second timeout  
- Benchmark reports generate successfully
- All jobs complete without infrastructure failures

## Remaining Items

The ingestion functionality has issues with CLI execution, but this doesn't affect the core benchmark framework. The workflow correctly handles ingestion failures and continues with analysis and reporting.

## Files Modified

1. `dev/benchmarks/tools/authoritative_benchmark.py` - Path resolution fix
2. `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml` - Health endpoint fixes  
3. `src/workspace_qdrant_mcp/core/client.py` - Async/await fix
4. `src/workspace_qdrant_mcp/core/collections.py` - Docstring corrections

## Verification

All changes tested locally with successful benchmark execution demonstrating proper:
- Module imports and path resolution
- Qdrant health check connectivity  
- Collection listing functionality
- End-to-end benchmark completion

The Performance Benchmarks CI workflow is now properly configured and should pass consistently.

# Service CLI Fix Demonstration

## Problem Fixed

The CLI command definition was incorrectly defaulting to system service installation, causing permission errors when users ran `wqm service install` without sudo.

## Before the Fix

```bash
# This would fail with permission errors
wqm service install

# Help text showed incorrect default
--system    Install as system service (requires sudo) [default: system]
```

## After the Fix

```bash
# This now works without sudo (defaults to user service)
wqm service install

# Explicit user service installation
wqm service install --user

# System service installation (requires sudo)
wqm service install --system
```

## Technical Changes Made

1. **Parameter Definition**: Changed from `system_service: bool` to `user_service: bool`
2. **Flag Structure**: Changed from `--system` only to `--user/--system` mutually exclusive
3. **Default Value**: Changed default from `False` (system) to `True` (user)
4. **Logic Simplification**: Removed flag conversion logic since parameter is now direct

## Verification

The fix ensures:
- ✅ `wqm service install` defaults to user service (no sudo required)
- ✅ `wqm service install --user` works explicitly  
- ✅ `wqm service install --system` requires appropriate permissions
- ✅ Help text shows correct default behavior
- ✅ All service commands (start, stop, restart, status, logs) follow same pattern

## Files Modified

- `src/workspace_qdrant_mcp/cli/commands/service.py` - Updated all service commands
  - install_service()
  - uninstall_service()
  - start_service()
  - stop_service()  
  - restart_service()
  - get_status()
  - get_logs()

This fix resolves the critical user experience issue where the CLI would fail with permission errors on the default installation command.

        for: 5m
        annotations:
          summary: "Memory usage above 85%"
```

#### Health Check Endpoints
```
GET /health                 # Basic health status
GET /health/detailed        # Comprehensive system status
GET /metrics               # Prometheus metrics
GET /admin/status          # Administrative status
```

### 5.3 Backup and Recovery Procedures

#### Automated Backup Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily backup script

BACKUP_DIR="/backups/workspace-qdrant-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# 1. Backup Qdrant collections
python scripts/backup_collections.py --output "$BACKUP_DIR/collections"

# 2. Backup configuration
cp -r config/ "$BACKUP_DIR/config/"

# 3. Export metadata
python scripts/export_metadata.py --output "$BACKUP_DIR/metadata.json"

# 4. Create archive
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR.tar.gz" "$BACKUP_DIR"
rm -rf "$BACKUP_DIR"

# 5. Upload to remote storage (if configured)
if [ -n "$S3_BACKUP_BUCKET" ]; then
    aws s3 cp "$BACKUP_DIR.tar.gz" "s3://$S3_BACKUP_BUCKET/daily/"
fi

echo "✅ Backup completed: $BACKUP_DIR.tar.gz"
```

#### Disaster Recovery Procedure
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Disaster recovery script

RESTORE_FILE="$1"
if [ -z "$RESTORE_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <backup_file.tar.gz>"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Starting disaster recovery from $RESTORE_FILE"

# 1. Stop all services
./scripts/shutdown.sh

# 2. Extract backup
RESTORE_DIR="/tmp/restore-$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p "$RESTORE_DIR"
tar -xzf "$RESTORE_FILE" -C "$RESTORE_DIR"

# 3. Restore Qdrant collections
python scripts/restore_collections.py --source "$RESTORE_DIR/*/collections"

# 4. Restore configuration
cp -r "$RESTORE_DIR/*/config/"* config/

# 5. Restart system
./scripts/startup.sh

echo "✅ Disaster recovery completed"
```

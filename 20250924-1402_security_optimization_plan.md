# Task 256.6: Security Hardening and Local Communication Optimization Plan

## Steps Breakdown:

### Phase 1: Security Hardening (1-6)
1. Add TLS certificate validation enhancement
2. Implement authentication token rotation
3. Enhance input sanitization and validation
4. Strengthen rate limiting and DoS protection
5. Secure inter-component communication channels
6. Add comprehensive security testing

### Phase 2: Communication Optimization (7-12)
7. Optimize gRPC communication patterns
8. Implement connection pooling improvements
9. Enhance communication circuit breakers
10. Optimize serialization/deserialization
11. Reduce communication overhead
12. Performance benchmarks and validation

### Phase 3: Testing and Documentation (13-15)
13. Comprehensive unit tests for security features
14. Integration tests for secure communication
15. Documentation and cleanup

## Current Architecture Analysis:
- gRPC-based communication between Rust engine and Python MCP server
- Basic circuit breaker pattern implemented
- SSL configuration with context-aware handling
- Rate limiting in middleware
- Connection management with limits
- Basic authentication token support

## Security Gaps Identified:
- TLS certificate validation could be enhanced
- No token rotation mechanism
- Input validation could be more comprehensive
- Rate limiting could be more sophisticated
- Inter-component communication security needs hardening

## Communication Optimization Opportunities:
- gRPC connection pooling improvements
- Enhanced circuit breaker patterns
- Serialization optimizations
- Reduce protocol overhead
- Better connection reuse patterns

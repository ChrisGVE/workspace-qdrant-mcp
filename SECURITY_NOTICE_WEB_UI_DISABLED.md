# üîí SECURITY NOTICE: Web UI Temporarily Disabled

**Date:** September 7, 2025  
**Status:** ACTIVE PROTECTION MEASURE  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  

## Overview

The web-ui submodule has been **temporarily disabled** in production configuration due to critical security vulnerabilities that pose immediate risks to system security and stability.

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities
- **Risk:** Arbitrary code execution in user browsers
- **Impact:** Potential data theft, session hijacking, malicious redirects
- **Vector:** User input validation failures in web interface

### 2. Memory Leak Issues
- **Risk:** Progressive memory consumption leading to system instability
- **Impact:** Service degradation, potential system crashes
- **Vector:** Improper resource cleanup in frontend components

### 3. Data Exposure Risks
- **Risk:** Potential unauthorized access to sensitive workspace data
- **Impact:** Information disclosure, privacy violations
- **Vector:** Insufficient access controls in web interface

## Immediate Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ Web UI Access Disabled
- **Location:** `src/workspace_qdrant_mcp/cli/main.py`
- **Action:** Commented out web_app import (line 83-84)
- **Action:** Disabled web command registration (lines 112-115)
- **Result:** `wqm web` commands no longer available

### ‚úÖ Security Warnings Added
- **Location:** `src/workspace_qdrant_mcp/cli/commands/web.py`
- **Action:** Added prominent security notice in module header
- **Result:** Clear documentation of disabled status and risks

### ‚úÖ Production Verification
- **Docker Config:** No web-ui services in `docker-compose.prod.yml` ‚úì
- **Production Config:** No web-ui dependencies in `production.yaml` ‚úì
- **Result:** Production systems protected from exposure

## System Impact Assessment

### ‚úÖ Core Functionality - UNAFFECTED
All primary workspace-qdrant-mcp features remain fully operational:
- ‚úÖ MCP server functionality
- ‚úÖ Document ingestion and processing
- ‚úÖ Semantic search capabilities
- ‚úÖ Folder watching and monitoring
- ‚úÖ Memory management system
- ‚úÖ Administrative commands
- ‚úÖ Configuration management

### üö´ Web Interface - DISABLED
The following are temporarily unavailable:
- Web-based UI for workspace interaction
- Browser-based search interface
- Visual collection management
- Web-based configuration tools

## Verification Steps

To confirm web-ui is properly disabled:

```bash
# Verify CLI commands no longer include web
wqm --help | grep -i web
# Should return no results

# Verify MCP functionality works
wqm admin status
wqm search project "test query"
wqm memory list
```

## Rollback Procedure

When vulnerabilities are resolved, re-enable by:

1. **Uncomment web_app import:**
   ```python
   # In src/workspace_qdrant_mcp/cli/main.py line 83-84:
   from .commands.web import web_app
   ```

2. **Uncomment web command registration:**
   ```python
   # In src/workspace_qdrant_mcp/cli/main.py lines 112-115:
   app.add_typer(
       web_app, name="web", help="Integrated web UI server with workspace features"
   )
   ```

3. **Remove security notices from web.py header**

4. **Test web functionality thoroughly before deployment**

## Security Timeline

- **2025-09-07:** Critical vulnerabilities identified in web-ui submodule
- **2025-09-07:** Immediate disable action implemented (this notice)
- **TBD:** Security audit and remediation phase
- **TBD:** Security testing and validation phase
- **TBD:** Re-enablement after full vulnerability resolution

## Contact Information

This security measure is part of ongoing security hardening efforts. The disable action ensures production systems remain protected while maintaining all core functionality.

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete security audit of web-ui submodule
2. Develop comprehensive remediation plan
3. Implement security fixes and testing
4. Re-enable with enhanced security measures
